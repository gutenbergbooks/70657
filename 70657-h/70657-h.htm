<h2 class="nobreak">INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Rev. Edward McKendrie Bounds</span> was passionately
devoted to his beloved Lord and Saviour
Jesus Christ. His devotion was extraordinary in
that he was praying and writing about Him all
the time, except during the hours of sleeping.</p>

<p>God gave Bounds an enlargedness of heart and
an insatiable desire to do service for Him. To
this end he enjoyed what I am pleased to term a
transcendent inspiration, else he could never have
brought out of his treasury things new and old far
exceeding anything we have known or read in the
last half century.</p>

<p>Bounds is easily the Betelguese of the devotional
sky. There is no man that has lived since
the days of the apostles that has surpassed him
in the depths of his marvelous research into the
Life of Prayer.</p>

<p>He was busily engaged in writing on his
manuscripts when the Lord said unto him, “Well
done, thou good and faithful servant, enter thou
into the joys of thy Lord.” His letters would
often come to me in Brooklyn, N. Y., in 1911,
1912 and 1913, saying, “Pray for me that God<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[vi]</span>
will give me new nerves and new visions to finish
the manuscripts.”</p>

<p>Wesley was of the sweetest and most forgiving
disposition, but when aroused he was a man of
the “keenest penetration with a gift of speech that
bit like the stroke of a whip.” Bounds was meek
and humble, and never did we know him to
retaliate upon any of his enemies. He cried over
them and wept praying for them early and late.</p>

<p>Wesley was easily gulled. “My brother,” said
Charles, on one occasion in disgusting accents,
“was, I believe, born for the benefit of knaves.”
No man could impose on Bounds’ credulity. He
was a diagnostician of rare ability. Bounds shied
away from all frauds in profession, and would
waste no time upon them.</p>

<p>Wesley was preaching and riding all day.
Bounds was praying and writing day and night.</p>

<p>Wesley would not allow any misrepresentation
of his doctrinal positions in his late years. Bounds
in this respect was very much like him.</p>

<p>Wesley came to his fame while yet alive. He
was always in the public eye. Bounds, while
editing a <i>Christian Advocate</i> for twelve years, was
little known out of his church.</p>

<p>Wesley at eighty-six could still preach on the
streets for thirty minutes. Bounds was able at
seventy-five in the first hour of the fourth watch
to pray for three hours upon his knees.</p>

<p>Wesley, at the time of his death, had enjoyed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">[vii]</span>
fifty-six years of preferment. His name was on
every tongue. Christianity was born again in
England under his mighty preaching and organization.
Bounds was comparatively unknown for
fifty years but will recover the “lost and forgotten
secret of the church” in the next fifty years.</p>

<p>Wesley’s piety and genius and popularity flowed
from his early life like a majestic river. Bounds’
has been dammed up, but now it is beginning to
sweep with resistless force and ere long he will
be the mighty Amazon of the devotional world.</p>

<p>Henry Crabbe Robinson said in his diary when
he heard Wesley preach at Colchester, “He stood
in a wide pulpit and on each side of him stood a
minister, and the two held him up. His voice was
feeble and he could hardly be heard, but his
reverend countenance, especially his long white
locks, formed a picture never to be forgotten.”
The writer of these lines gave up his pulpit in
Brooklyn in 1912 to Rev. E. M. Bounds just ten
months before his death. His voice was feeble
and his periods were not rounded out. His sermon
was only twenty minutes long, when he quietly
came to the end and seemed exhausted.</p>

<p>Wesley had sufficient money and to spare during
all his career. Bounds did not care for money.
He did not depreciate it; he considered it the lowest
order of power.</p>

<p>Wesley died with “an eye beaming and lips
breaking into praise.” “The best of all is God<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[viii]</span>
with us,” Bounds wrote the writer of these lines.
“When He is ready I am ready; I long to taste the
joys of the heavenlies.”</p>

<p>Wesley said, “The World is my parish.”
Bounds prayed as if the universe was his zone.</p>

<p>Wesley was the incarnation of unworldliness,
the embodiment of magnanimity. Bounds was the
incarnation of unearthliness, humility and self-denial.
Wesley will live in the hearts of saints
for everlasting ages. Bounds eternally.</p>

<p>Wesley sleeps in City Road Chapel grounds,
among his “bonny dead,” under marble, with
fitting tribute chiseled in prose, awaiting the Resurrection.
Bounds sleeps in Washington, Georgia,
cemetery, without marble covering, awaiting the
Bridegroom’s coming.</p>

<p>These two men held ideals high and clear beyond
the reach of other men. Has this race of
men entirely gone out of the world now that they
are dead? Let us pray.</p>

<small>PRAYING SAINTS OF THE OLD TESTAMENTS</small></h2>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>The Holy Spirit will give to the praying saint the
brightness of an immortal hope, the music of a deathless
song, in His baptism and communion with the heart. He
will give sweeter and more enlarged visions of heaven
until the taste for other things will pall, and other visions
will grow dim and distant. He will put notes of other
worlds in human hearts until all earth’s music is discord
and songless.</i>—<span class="smcap">Rev. E. M. Bounds.</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Testament</span> history is filled with accounts
of praying saints. The leaders of Israel in those
early days were noted for their praying habits.
Prayer is the one thing which stands out prominently
in their lives.</p>

<p>To begin with, note the incident in Joshua, 10th
chapter, where the very heavenly bodies were
made subject to prayer. A prolonged battle was
on between the Israelites and their enemies, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
when night was rapidly coming on, and it was discovered
that a few more hours of daylight were
needful to ensure victory for the Lord’s hosts,
Joshua, that sturdy man of God, stepped into the
breach, with prayer. The sun was too rapidly
declining in the west for God’s people to reap the
full fruits of a noted victory, and Joshua, seeing
how much depended upon the occasion, cried out
in the sight and in the hearing of Israel, “Sun,
stand thou still upon Gideon, and thou moon in
the Valley of Ajalon.” And the sun actually
stood still and the moon stopped on her course at
the command of this praying man of God, till the
Lord’s people had avenged themselves upon the
Lord’s enemies.</p>

<p>Jacob was not a strict pattern of righteousness,
prior to his all-night praying. Yet he was a man
of prayer and believed in the God of prayer. So
we find him swift to call upon God in prayer when
he was in trouble. He was fleeing from home
fearing Esau, on his way to the home of Laban,
a kinsman. As night came on, he lighted on a
certain place to refresh himself with sleep, and as
he slept he had a wonderful dream in which he
saw the angels of God ascending and descending
on a ladder which stretched from earth to heaven.
It was no wonder when he awoke he was constrained
to exclaim, “Surely the Lord is in this
place and I knew it not.”</p>

<p>Then it was he entered into a very definite covenant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
with Almighty God, and in prayer vowed a
vow unto the Lord, saying, “If God will be with
me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and
will give me bread to eat and raiment to put on,
so that I come again to my father’s house in
peace; and shall the Lord be my God, and this
stone which I have set for a pillar shall be God’s
house; and of all that thou shalt give me, I will
surely give one-tenth unto thee.”</p>

<p>With a deep sense of his utter dependence upon
God, and desiring above all the help of God,
Jacob conditioned his prayer for protection, blessing
and guidance by a solemn vow. Thus Jacob
supported his prayer to God by a vow.</p>

<p>Twenty years had passed while Jacob tarried
at the house of Laban, and he had married two of
his daughters and God had given him children.
He had increased largely in wealth, and he resolved
to leave that place and return home to
where he had been reared. Nearing home it occurred
to him that he must meet his brother Esau,
whose anger had not abated notwithstanding the
passage of many years. God, however, had said
to him, “Return to thy father’s house and to thy
kindred, and I will be with thee.” In this dire
emergency doubtless God’s promise and his vow
made long ago came to his mind, and he took himself
to an all-night season of prayer. Here comes
to our notice that strange, inexplicable incident of
the angel struggling with Jacob all night long, till<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
Jacob at last obtained the victory. “I will not let
thee go except thou bless me.” And then and
there, in answer to his earnest, pressing and importunate
praying, he was richly blessed personally
and his name was changed. But even more
than that, God went ahead of Jacob’s desire, and
strangely moved upon the angry nature of Esau,
and lo and behold, when Jacob met him next day,
Esau’s anger had entirely abated, and he vied with
Jacob in showing kindness to his brother who had
wronged him. No explanation of this remarkable
change in the heart of Esau is satisfactory which
leaves out prayer.</p>

<p>Samuel, the mighty intercessor in Israel and a
man of God, was the product of his mother’s
prayer. Hannah is a memorable example of the
nature and benefits of importunate praying. No
son had been born to her and she yearned for a
man child. Her whole soul was in her desire. So
she went to the house of worship, where Eli, the
priest of God, was, and staggering under the
weight of which bore down on her heart she was
beside herself and seemed to be really intoxicated.
Her desires were too intense for articulation.
“She poured out her soul in prayer before the
Lord.” Insuperable natural difficulties were in
the way, but she “multiplied her praying,” as the
passage means, till her God-lightened heart and
her bright face recorded the answer to her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
prayers, and Samuel was hers by a conscious faith
and a nation was restored by faith.</p>

<p>Samuel was born in answer to the vowful prayer
of Hannah, for the solemn covenant which she
made with God if He would grant her request
must not be left out of the account in investigating
this incident of a praying woman and the answer
she received. It is suggestive in James 5:15 that
“The prayer of faith shall save the sick,” the
word translated means a vow. So that prayer
in its highest form of faith is that prayer which
carries the whole man as a sacrificial offering.
Thus devoting the whole man himself, and his
all, to God in a definite, intelligent vow, never
to be broken, in a quenchless and impassioned
desire for heaven—such an attitude of self-devotement
to God mightily helps praying. Samson
is somewhat of a paradox when we examine his
religious character. But amid all his faults, which
were grave in the extreme, he knew the God
who hears prayer and he knew how to talk to
God.</p>

<p>No farness to which Israel had gone, no depth
to which Israel had fallen, no chains however
iron with which Israel was bound but that their
cry to God easily spanned the distance, fathomed
the depths, and broke the chains. It was the
lesson they were ever learning and always forgetting,
that prayer always brought God to their
deliverance, and that there was nothing too hard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
for God to do for His people. We find all of
God’s saints in straits at different times in some
way or another. Their straits are, however, often
the heralds of their great triumphs. But for
whatever cause their straits come, or of what
kind soever, there is no strait of any degree of
direness or from any source whatsoever of any
nature whatsoever, from which prayer could not
extricate them. The great strength of Samson
does not relieve him nor extricate him out of
his straits. Read what the Scriptures say:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“And when he came unto Lehi, the Philistines
shouted against him; and the Spirit of the Lord
came mightily upon him, and the cords that were
upon his arms became as flax that was burnt with
fire, and his bands loosed from off his hands.</p>

<p>“And he found a new jawbone of an ass, and
put forth his hand, and took it, and slew a thousand
men therewith.</p>

<p>“And Samson said, With the jawbone of an ass,
heaps upon heaps, with the jawbone of an ass
have I slain a thousand men.</p>

<p>“And it came to pass when he had made an
end of speaking, that he cast away the jawbone
out of his hand, and called that place Ramath-Lehi.</p>

<p>“And he was sore athirst, and called on the
Lord, and said, Thou hast given this great deliverance
into the hand of thy servant, and now
shall I die of thirst, and fall into the hand of the
uncircumcised?</p>

<p>“But God clave a hollow place that was in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
jaw, and there came water thereout; and when he
had drunk, his spirit came again and he revived.”</p>
</div>

<p>We have another incident in the case of this
strange Old Testament character, showing how,
when in great straits, their minds involuntarily
turned to God in prayer. However irregular in
life they were, however far from God they departed,
however sinful they might be when trouble
came upon these men, they invariably called upon
God for deliverance, and, as a rule, when they
repented God heard their cries and granted their
requests. This incident comes at the close of
Samson’s life, and shows us how his life ended.</p>

<p>Read the record as found in Judges, 16th chapter.
Samson had formed an alliance with Delilah,
a heathen woman, and she, in connivance with the
Philistines, sought to discover the source of his
immense strength. Three successive times she
failed, and at last by her persistence and womanly
arts persuaded Samson to divulge to her the wonderful
secret. So in an unsuspecting hour he
disclosed to her the fact that the source of his
strength was in his hair which had never been
cut; and she deprived him of his great physical
power by cutting off his hair. She called for the
Philistines, and they came and put out his eyes
and otherwise mistreated him.</p>

<p>On an occasion when the Philistines were
gathered together to offer a great sacrifice to
Dagon, their idol god, they called for Samson to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
make sport for them. And the following is the
account as he stood there presumably the laughing-stock
of these enemies of his and of God.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“And Samson said unto the lad that held him
by the hand, Suffer me that I may feel the pillars
whereupon the house standeth, that I may lean
upon them.</p>

<p>“Now the house was full of men and women;
and all the lords of the Philistines were there;
and there were upon the roof about three thousand
men and women, that beheld while Samson
made sport.</p>

<p>“And Samson called unto the Lord and said,
O Lord God, remember me, I pray thee, and
strengthen me, I pray thee, only this once, my
God, that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines
for my two eyes. And Samson took hold of
the two middle pillars upon which the house
stood, and on which it was borne up, of the one
with his right hand and of the other with his left.</p>

<p>“And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines.
And he bowed himself with all his might,
and the house fell upon the lords, and upon all
the people that were there within. So the dead
which he slew at his death were more than they
which he slew in his life.”</p>

<small>PRAYING SAINTS OF THE OLD TESTAMENTS</small></h2>

<p class="center">(<i>Continued</i>)</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Bishop Lambeth and Wainwright had a great M. E.
Mission in Osaka, Japan. One day the order came from
high up that no more meetings would be allowed in the
city by Protestants. Lambeth and Wainwright did all
they could but the high officials were obstinate and unrelenting.
They then retired to the room of prayer.
Supper time came and the Japanese girl came to summon
them to their meal, but she fell under the power of prayer.
Mrs. Lambeth came to find what the matter was and
fell under the same power. They then rose and went
to the mission hall and opened it: and at once commenced
meeting. God fell upon the assembly and two
of the sons of the city officials came to the altar and were
saved. Next morning one of the officials in authority
came to the mission and said, “Go on with your meetings,
you will not be interrupted.” The Osaka daily paper
came out with box car letters saying, “THE CHRISTIAN’S
GOD CAME TO TOWN LAST NIGHT.”</i>—<span class="smcap">Rev. H. C. Morrison.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jonah</span>, the man who prayed in the fish’s belly,
brings to view another remarkable instance of
these Old Testament worthies who were given
to prayer. This man Jonah, a prophet of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
Lord, was a fugitive from God and from the place
of duty. He had been sent on a mission of warning
to wicked Nineveh, and had been commanded
to cry out against them, “for their wickedness is
come up before me,” said God. But Jonah,
through fear or otherwise, declined to obey God,
and took passage on a ship for Tarshish, fleeing
from God. He seems to have overlooked the
plain fact that the same God who had sent him
on that alarming mission had His eye upon him as
he hid himself on board that vessel. A storm
arose as the vessel was on its way to Tarshish,
and it was decided to throw Jonah overboard in
order to appease God and to avert the destruction
of the boat and of all on board. But God
was there as He had been with Jonah from the
beginning. He had prepared a great fish to swallow
Jonah, in order to arrest him, to defeat him
in his flight from the post of duty, and to save
Jonah that he might help to carry out the purposes
of God.</p>

<p>It was Jonah who was in the fish’s belly, in that
great strait, and passing through a strange experience,
who called upon God, who heard him and
caused the fish to vomit him out on dry land. What
possible force could rescue him from this fearful
place? He seemed hopelessly lost, in “the belly
of hell,” as good as dead and damned. But he
prays—what else can he do? And this is just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
what he had been accustomed to do when in trouble
before.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I cried by reason of my affliction unto the
Lord, and he heard me; out of the belly of hell
cried I, and thou heardst my voice.”</p>
</div>

<p>And the Lord spake unto the fish, and it vomited
out Jonah upon the dry land.</p>

<p>Like others he joined prayer to a vow he had
made, for he says in his prayer, “But I will sacrifice
unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving; I will
pay that that I have vowed. Salvation is of the
Lord.”</p>

<p>Prayer was the mighty force which brought
Jonah from “the belly of hell.” Prayer, mighty
prayer, has secured the end. Prayer brought God
to the rescue of unfaithful Jonah, despite his sin
of fleeing from duty, and God could not deny his
prayer. Nothing is too hard for prayer because
nothing is too hard for God.</p>

<p>That answered prayer of Jonah in the fish’s
belly in its mighty results became an Old Testament
type of the miraculous power displayed in
the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.
Our Lord puts His seal of truth upon the fact of
Jonah’s prayer and resurrection.</p>

<p>Nothing can be simpler than these cases of
God’s mighty deliverance. Nothing is plainer
than that prayer has to do with God directly
and simply. Nothing is clearer than that prayer
has its only worth and significance in the great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
fact that God hears and answers prayer. This
the Old Testament saints strongly believed. It is
the one fact that stands out continuously and
prominently in their lives. They were essentially
men of prayer.</p>

<p>How greatly we need a school to teach the art
of praying! This simplest of all arts and
mightiest of all forces is ever in danger of being
forgotten or depraved. The further we get
away from our mother’s knees, the further do we
get away from the true art of praying. All our
after-schooling and our after-teachers unteach us
the lessons of prayer. Men prayed well in Old
Testament times because they were simple men
and lived in simple times. They were childlike,
lived in childlike times and had childlike faith.</p>

<p>In citing the Old Testament saints noted for
their praying habits, by no means must David
be overlooked, a man who preëminently was a
man of prayer. With him prayer was a habit,
for we hear him say, “Evening and morning and
at noon will I pray and cry aloud.” Prayer with
the Sweet Psalmist of Israel was no strange occupation.
He knew the way to God and was
often found in that way. It is no wonder we
hear his call so clear and impressive, “O come, let
us worship and bow down; let us kneel before the
Lord our Maker.” He knew God as the one
being who could answer prayer: “O thou that
hearest prayer, to thee shall all flesh come.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>When God smote the child born of Bathsheba,
because David had by his grievous sins given occasion
of the enemies of God to blaspheme, it is
no surprise that we find him engaged in a week’s
praying, asking God for the life of the child. The
habit of his life asserted itself in this great emergency
in his home, and we find him fasting and
praying for the child to recover. The fact that
God denied his request does not at all affect the
question of David’s habit of praying. Even
though he did not receive what he asked for, his
faith in God was not in the least affected. The
fact is that while God did not give him the life
of that baby boy, He afterward gave him another
son, even Solomon. So that possibly the latter
son was a far great blessing to him than would
have been the child for whom he prayed.</p>

<p>In close connection with this season of prayer,
we must not overlook David’s penitential praying
when Nathan, by command of God, uncovered
David’s two great sins of adultery and murder.
At once David acknowledged his wickedness, saying
unto Nathan, “I have sinned.” And as showing
his deep grief over his sin, his heart-broken
spirit, and his genuine repentance, it is only necessary
to read Psalm 51 where confession of sin,
deep humiliation and prayer are the chief ingredients
of the Psalm.</p>

<p>David knew where to find a sin-pardoning God,
and was received back again and had the joys of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
salvation restored to him by earnest, sincere, penitential
praying. Thus are all sinners brought
into the divine favor, thus do they find pardon,
and thus do they find a new heart.</p>

<p>The entire Book of Psalms brings prayer to the
front, and prayer fairly bristles before our eyes
as we read this devotional book of the Scriptures.</p>

<p>Nor must even Solomon be overlooked in the
famous catalogue of men who prayed in Old
Testament times. Whatever their faults, they
did not forget the God who hears prayer nor did
they cease to seek the God of prayer. While
this wise man in his later life departed from God,
and his sun set under a cloud, we find him praying
at the commencement of his reign.</p>

<p>Solomon went to Gibeon to offer sacrifice, which
always meant that prayer went in close companionship
with sacrifice, and while there, the Lord
appeared to Solomon in a vision by night, saying
unto him, “Ask what I shall give thee.” The
sequel shows the material out of which Solomon’s
character was formed. What was his request?</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“O Lord my God, thou hast made thy servant
king instead of my father; and I am but a little
child; I know not how to go out or to come in.</p>

<p>“And thy servant is in the midst of thy people
which thou hast chosen, a great people, that cannot
be numbered nor counted for multitude.</p>

<p>“Give therefore thy servant an understanding
heart to judge thy people, that I may discern between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
good and bad; for who is able to judge
this thy so great a people?”</p>
</div>

<p>We do not wonder that it is recorded as a result
of such praying:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“And the speech pleased the Lord, that Solomon
had asked this thing.</p>

<p>“And God said unto him, Because thou hast
asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself
long life; neither hast asked riches for thyself,
nor hast asked the life of thy enemies, but has
asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment;</p>

<p>“Behold I have done according to thy word;
Lo, I have given thee a wise and understanding
heart; so that there was none like thee before
thee, neither after thee shall any arise like unto
thee.</p>

<p>“Also I have given thee that which thou hast
not asked, both riches and honor; so that there
shall not be any among the kings like unto thee all
thy days.”</p>
</div>

<p>What praying was this! What self-deprecation
and simplicity! “I am but a little child.”
How he specified the one thing needful! And
see how much more he received than that for
which he asked!</p>

<p>Take the remarkable prayer at the dedication
of the temple. Possibly this is the longest recorded
prayer in God’s Word. How comprehensive,
pointed, intensive, it is! Solomon could not
afford to lay the foundations of God’s house in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
anything else but in prayer. And God heard this
prayer as he heard him before, “And when
Solomon had made an end of his praying, the fire
came down from heaven, and the glory of the
Lord filled the house,” thus God attested the
acceptance of this house of worship and of
Solomon, the praying king.</p>

<p>The list of these Old Testament saints given
to prayer grows as we proceed, and is too long to
notice at length all of them. But the name of
Isaiah, the great evangelical prophet, and that of
Jeremiah, the weeping prophet, must not be left
out of the account. Still others might be mentioned.
These are sufficient, and with their
names we may close the list. Let careful readers
of the Old Scriptures keep the prayer question in
mind, and they will see how great a place prayer
occupied in the minds and lives of the men of
those early days.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br>

<small>ABRAHAM, THE MAN OF PRAYER</small></h2>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Oh for determined men and women, who will rise
early and really burn out for God. Oh for a faith that
will sweep into heaven with the early dawning of the
morning and have ships from a shoreless sea loaded in
the soul’s harbor ere the ordinary laborer has knocked
the dew from his scythe or the huckster has turned from
his pallet of straw to spread nature’s treasures of fruit
before the early buyers.</i>—<span class="smcap">Rev. Homer W. Hodge.</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Abraham</span>, the friend of God, was a striking
illustration of one of the Old Testament saints
who believed strongly in prayer. Abraham was
not a shadowy figure by any means. In the
simplicity and dimness of the patriarchal dispensation,
as illustrated by him, we learn the
worth of prayer, as well as discover its antiquity.
The fact is, prayer reaches back to the first ages
of man on earth. We see how the energy of
prayer is absolutely required in the simplest as
well as in the most complex dispensations of God’s
grace. When we study Abraham’s character, we
find that after his call to go out into an unknown
country, on his journey with his family and his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
household servants, wherever he tarried by the
way for the night or longer, he always erected an
altar, and “called upon the name of the Lord.”
And this man of faith and prayer was one of the
first to erect a family altar, around which to
gather his household and offer the sacrifices of
worship, of praise and of prayer. These altars
built by Abraham were, first of all, essentially
altars about which he gathered his household, as
distinguished from secret prayer.</p>

<p>As God’s revelations became fuller and more
perfect, Abraham’s prayerfulness increased, and
it was at one of these spiritual eras that “Abraham
fell on his face and God talked with him.” On
still another occasion we find this man, “the father
of the faithful,” on his face before God, astonished
almost to incredulity at the purposes and
revelations of Almighty God to him in promising
him a son in his old age, and the wonderful engagements
which God made concerning his promised
son.</p>

<p>Even Ishmael’s destiny is shaped by Abraham’s
prayer when he prayed, “O that Ishmael might
live before thee!”</p>

<p>What a remarkable story is that of Abraham’s
standing before God repeating his intercessions for
the wicked city of Sodom, the home of his nephew
Lot, doomed by God’s decision to destroy it!
Sodom’s fate was for a while stayed by Abraham’s
praying, and was almost entirely relieved by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
humility and insistence of the praying of this man
who believed strongly in prayer and who knew
how to pray. No other recourse was opened to
Abraham to save Sodom but prayer. Perhaps the
failure to ultimately rescue Sodom from her doom
of destruction was due to Abraham’s optimistic
view of the spiritual condition of things in that
city. It might have been possible,—who knows?—that
if Abraham had entreated God once more,
and asked Him to spare the city if even one
righteous man was found there, for Lot’s sake,
He might have heeded Abraham’s request.</p>

<p>Note another instance in the life of Abraham
as showing how he was a man of prayer and had
power with God. Abraham had journeyed to and
was sojourning in Gerar. Fearing that Abimelech
might kill him and appropriate Sarah his wife
to his own lustful uses, he deceived Abimelech by
claiming that Sarah was his sister. God appeared
unto Abimelech in a dream and warned
him not to touch Sarah, telling him that she was
the wife of Abraham, and not his sister. Then
he said unto Abimelech, “Now restore therefore
the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall
pray for thee, and thou shalt live.” And the conclusion
of the incident is thus recorded: “So
Abraham prayed unto God, and God healed
Abimelech and his wife, and his maid servants,
and they bare children. For the Lord had fast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech
because of Sarah, his wife.”</p>

<p>This was a case somewhat on the line of that
of Job at the close of his fearful experience and
his terrible trials, when his friends, not understanding
Job, neither comprehending God’s dealings
with this servant of His, falsely charged Job
with being in sin as the cause of all his troubles.
God said to these friends of Job, “My servant Job
shall pray for you, for him will I accept. And
the Lord turned the captivity of Job when he had
prayed for his friends.”</p>

<p>Almighty God knew His servant Job as a man
of prayer, and He could afford to send these
friends of Job to him to pray in order to carry
out and fulfill His plans and purposes.</p>

<p>It was Abraham’s rule to stand before the Lord
in prayer. His life was surcharged with prayer
and Abraham’s dispensation was sanctified by
prayer. For wherever he halted in his pilgrimage,
prayer was his inseparable accompaniment.
Side by side with the altar of sacrifice was the
altar of prayer. He got up early in the morning
to the place where he stood before the Lord in
prayer.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br>

<small>MOSES, THE MIGHTY INTERCESSOR</small></h2>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Intercessory Prayer is a powerful means of grace to
the praying man. Martyn observes that at times of inward
dryness and depression, he had often found a delightful
revival in the act of praying for others for their
conversion, or sanctification, or prosperity in the work of
the Lord. His dealings with God for them about these
gifts and blessings were for himself the divinely natural
channel of a renewed insight into his own part and lot in
Christ, into Christ as his own rest and power, into the
“perfect freedom” of an entire yielding of himself to his
Master for His work.</i>—<span class="smcap">Bishop Handley C. G. Moule.</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Prayer</span> unites with the purposes of God and
lays itself out to secure those purposes. How
often would the wise and benign will of God fail in
its rich and beneficent ends by the sins of the people
if prayer had not come in to arrest wrath and
make the promise sure! Israel as a nation would
have met their just destruction and their just fate
after their apostasy with the golden calf had it
not been for the interposition and unfainting importunity
of Moses’ forty days’ and forty nights’
praying!</p>

<p>Marvelous was the effect of the character of
Moses by his marvelous praying. His near and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
sublime intercourse with God in the giving of the
law worked no transfiguration of character like
the tireless praying of those forty days in prayer
with God. It was when he came down from that
long struggle of prayer that his face shone with
such dazzling brightness. Our mounts of transfiguration
and the heavenly shining in character
and conduct are born of seasons of wrestling
prayer. All-night praying has changed many a
Jacob, the supplanter, into Israel, a prince, who
has power with God and with men.</p>

<p>No mission was more majestic in purpose and
results than that of Moses, and none was more
responsible, diligent and difficult. In it we are
taught the sublime ministry and rule of prayer.
Not only is it the medium of supply and support,
but it is a compassionate agency through which
the pitying long-suffering of God has an outflow.
Prayer is a medium to restrain God’s wrath, that
mercy might rejoice against judgment.</p>

<p>Moses himself and his mission were the creation
of prayer. Thus it is recorded: “When
Jacob was come into Egypt, and your fathers cried
unto the Lord, then the Lord sent Moses and
Aaron, who brought your fathers out of Egypt,
and made them dwell in this place.” This is the
genesis of the great movement for the deliverance
of the Hebrews from Egyptian bondage.</p>

<p>The great movements of God have had their
origin and energy in and were shaped by prayers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
of men. Prayer has directly to deal with God.
Other ends, collateral and incidental, are secured
by prayer, but mainly, almost solely, prayer has
to deal with God. He is pleased to order His
policy, and base His action on the prayers of
His saints. Prayer influences God greatly. Moses
cannot do God’s great work, though God-commissioned,
without praying much. Moses cannot
govern God’s people and carry out the divine
plans, without having his censer filled full of the
incense of prayer. The work of God cannot be
done without the fire and fragrance are always
burning, ascending and perfuming.</p>

<p>Moses’ prayers are often found relieving the
terrible stroke of God’s wrath. Four times were
the prayers of Moses solicited by Pharaoh to relieve
him of the fearful stroke of God’s wrath.
“Entreat the Lord,” most earnestly begged
Pharaoh of Moses, while the loathsome frogs
were upon him. And “Moses cried unto the Lord
because of the frogs which God had brought
against the land of Egypt, and the Lord did according
to the word of Moses.” When the grievous
plague of flies had corrupted the whole land,
Pharaoh again piteously cried out to Moses, “Entreat
for me.” Moses went out from Pharaoh
and entreated the Lord, and the Lord again did
according to the word of Moses. The mighty
thunderings and hail in their alarming and destructive
fury extorted from this wicked king the very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
same earnest appeal to Moses, “Entreat the
Lord.” And Moses went out from the city into
privacy, and alone with Almighty God, he “spread
abroad his hands unto the Lord, and the thunderings
and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured
out upon the earth.”</p>

<p>Though Moses was the man of law, yet with
him prayer asserted its mighty force. With him,
as in the more spiritual dispensation, it could
have been said, “My house is the house of prayer.”</p>

<p>Moses accepts at its full face value the foundation
principle of praying that prayer has to do
with God. With Abraham we saw this clearly and
strongly enunciated. With Moses it is clearer
and stronger still if possible. It declared that
prayer affected God, that God was influenced in
His conduct by prayer, and that God hears and
answers prayer even when the hearing and answering
might change His conduct and reverse His
action. Stronger than all other laws, and more
inflexible than any other decree, is the decree,
“Call upon me and I will answer you.”</p>

<p>Moses lived near God, and had the freest and
most unhindered and boldest access to God, but
this, instead of abating the necessity of prayer,
made it more necessary, obvious and powerful.
Familiarity and closeness to God gives relish,
frequency, point and potency to prayer. Those
who know God the best are the richest and most
powerful in prayer. Little acquaintance with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
God, and strangeness and coldness to Him, make
prayer a rare and feeble thing.</p>

<p>There were conditions of extremity to which
Moses was reduced which prayer did not relieve,
but there is no position of extremity which baffles
God, when prayer puts God into the matter.</p>

<p>Moses’ mission was a divine one. It was
ordered, directed and planned by God. The more
there is of God in a movement, the more there is
of prayer, conspicuous and controlling. Moses’
prayer rule of the church illustrates the necessity
of courage and persistence in prayer. For forty
days and forty nights was Moses pressing his
prayer for the salvation of the Lord’s people. So
intense was his concern for them which accompanied
his long season of praying, that bodily
infirmities and appetites were retired. How
strangely the prayers of a righteous man affect
God is evident from the exclamation of God to
Moses, “Now, therefore, let me alone, that my
wrath may wax hot against them, that I may
consume them; and I will make of thee a great
nation.” The presence of such an influence over
God fills us with astonishment, awe and fear.
How lofty, bold and devoted must be such a
pleader!</p>

<p>Read this from the divine record:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“And Moses returned unto the Lord, and said,
Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have
made them gods of gold!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>“Yet now if thou wilt forgive their sin—and
if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which
thou hast written.</p>

<p>“And the Lord said unto Moses, Whosoever
hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my
book.</p>

<p>“Therefore now go, and lead the people unto
the place of which I have spoken unto thee. Behold
my angel shall go before thee.”</p>
</div>

<p>The rebellion of Korah was the occasion of
God’s anger flaming out against the whole congregation
of Israel, who sympathized with these
rebels. Again Moses appears on the stage of
action, this time having Aaron to join him in
intercession for these sinners against God. But
it only shows that in a serious time like this Moses
knew to whom to go for relief, and was encouraged
to pray that God would stay His wrath
and spare Israel. Here is what is said about the
matter:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“And the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron,
saying,</p>

<p>“Separate yourselves from among this congregation,
that I may consume them in a moment.</p>

<p>“And they fell on their faces, and said, O God,
the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man
sin, and wilt thou be wroth with all the congregation?”</p>
</div>

<p>The assumption, pride and rebellion of Miriam,
sister of Moses, in which she had the presence
and sympathy of Aaron, put the praying and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
spirit of Moses in the noblest and most amiable
light. Because of her sin God smote her with
leprosy. But Moses made tender and earnest
intercession for his sister who had so grievously
offended God, and his prayer saved her from the
fearful and incurable malady.</p>

<p>The record is intensely interesting, and follows
just here:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“And the anger of the Lord was kindled
against them and the cloud departed from off the
tabernacle and behold, Miriam became leprous,
white as snow; and Aaron looked upon Miriam,
and behold she was leprous.</p>

<p>“And Aaron said unto Moses, Alas, my Lord,
I beseech thee, lay not the sin unto us, wherein
we have done foolishly, and wherein we have
sinned.</p>

<p>“Let her not be as one dead, of whom the
flesh is half consumed when he cometh out of his
mother’s womb.</p>

<p>“And Moses cried unto the Lord, saying, Heal
her, O God, I beseech thee.</p>

<p>“And the Lord said unto Moses, If her father
had but spit in her face, should she not be
ashamed seven days? Let her be shut out from
the camp seven days, and after that let her be
received again.”</p>
</div>

<p>The murmurings of the children of Israel furnished
conditions which called into play the full
forces of prayer. They impressively bring out
the intercessory feature of prayer and disclose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
Moses in his great office as an intercessor before
God in behalf of others. It was at Marah, where
the waters were bitter and the people grievously
murmured against Moses and God.</p>

<p>Here is the Scripture account:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“And when they came to Marah, they could
not drink of the waters of Marah; for they were
bitter; therefore the name of it was called Marah.</p>

<p>“And the people murmured against Moses, saying,
What shall we drink?</p>

<p>“And Moses cried unto the Lord; and the
Lord showed him a tree, which when he had cast
into the waters, the waters were made sweet;
there he made for them a statute and an ordinance,
and there he proved them.”</p>
</div>

<p>How many of the bitter places of the earth
have been sweetened by prayer the records of
eternity alone will disclose.</p>

<p>Again at Taberah the people complained, and
God became angry with them, and Moses came
again to the front and stepped into the breach and
prayed for them. Here is the brief account:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“And when the people complained, it displeased
the Lord; and the Lord heard it; and his
anger was kindled; and the fire of the Lord
burnt among them, and consumed them that were
in the uttermost part of the camp.</p>

<p>“And the people cried unto Moses, and when
Moses prayed unto the Lord, the fire was
quenched.”</p>
</div>

<p>Moses got what he asked for. His praying
was specific and God’s answer was likewise specific.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
Always was he heard by Almighty God when
he prayed, and always was he answered by God.
Once the answer was not specific. He had prayed
to go into Canaan. The answer came but not
what he asked for. He was given a vision of the
Promised Land, but he was not allowed to go
over Jordan into that land of promise. It was
a prayer on the order of Paul’s when he prayed
three times for the removal of the thorn in the
flesh. But the thorn was not removed. Grace,
however, was vouchsafed which made the thorn
a blessing.</p>

<p>It must not be thought that because the 90th
Psalm is incorporated with what is known as the
“Psalms of David,” that David was the author
of it. By general consent it is attributed to
Moses, and it gives us a sample of the praying
of this giver of the law of God to the people. It
is a prayer worth studying. It is sacred to us because
it has been the requiem uttered over our
dead for years that are past and gone. It has
blessed the grave of many a sleeping saint. But
its very familiarity may cause us to lose its full
meaning. Wise will we be if we digest it, not
for the dead, but for the living, that it may teach
us how to live, how to pray while living, and how
to die. “So teach us to number our days that we
may apply our hearts to wisdom. Establish thou
the work of our hands, yea, the work of our hands
establish thou it.”</p>

<small>ELIJAH, THE PRAYING PROPHET</small></h2>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>“I have known men,” says Goodwin—it must have
been himself—“who came to God for nothing else but
just to come to Him, they so loved Him. They scorned
to soil Him and themselves with any other errand
than just purely to be alone with Him in His presence.
Friendship is best kept up, even among men, by frequent
visits; and the more free and defecate those frequent
visits are, and the less occasioned by business, or
necessity, or custom they are, the more friendly and welcome
they are.”</i>—<span class="smcap">Rev. Alexander Whyte.</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Elijah</span> is preëminently the elder of the
prophets. The crown, the throne and the scepter
are his. His garments are white with flame. He
seems exalted in his fiery and prayerful nature, as a
being seemingly superhuman, but the New Testament
places him alongside of us as man of like
nature with us. Instead of placing himself outside
the sphere of humanity, in the marvelous
results of his praying, it points to him as an example
to be imitated and as inspiration to stimulate
us. To pray like Elijah, and to have results
like Elijah, is the crying need of the times.</p>

<p>Elijah had learned the lesson of prayer, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
had graduated in that divine school ere we know
him. Somewhere in the secret places, on mountain
or in plain, he had been alone with God, an
intercessor against the debasing idolatry of Ahab.
Mightily had his prayers prevailed with God.
How confidently and well assured were the
answers to his praying.</p>

<p>He had been talking with God about vengeance.
He was the embodiment of his times.
Those times were times of vengeance. The intercessor
was not to be clothed with an olive
branch with its fillet of wood, the symbol of a
suppliant for mercy, but with fire, the symbol
of justice and the messenger of wrath. How
abruptly does he come before us in the presence
of Ahab! Well assured and with holy boldness
does he declare before the astonished, cowering
king his message of fearful import, a message
gained by his earnest praying,—“in praying he
prayed that it might not rain,” and God did not
deny his prayer. “As the Lord God of Israel
liveth, before whom I stand, there shall not be
dew nor rain these years but according to my
word.”</p>

<p>The secret of his praying and the character of
the man are found in the words, “Before whom
I stand.” We are here reminded of Gabriel’s
words to Zacharias in informing this priest of the
coming of a son to him and his wife in their old
age: “I am Gabriel that standeth in the presence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
of God.” The archangel Gabriel had scarcely
more unflinching devotion, more courage, and
more readiness of obedience, and more jealousy
of God’s honor, than Elijah. What projecting
power do we see in his prayer! “And it rained
not on the earth by the space of three years and
six months.” What omnipotent forces which
can command the powers of nature! “Not dew
nor rain.” What man is this who dares utter
such a claim or assert such a power? If his claim
be false, he is a fanatic or a madman. If his claim
be true, he has stayed the benevolent arm of
Omnipotence, and put himself, by God’s leave, in
God’s place. The accursed and burnt-up land
and the fiery, rainless and dewless days and nights,
attest the truth of his saying, and prove the sternness,
strength, firmness and passion of the man
who holds back the clouds and stays the blessed
visitation of the rain. Elijah is his name, and
this attests the truth of that name, “My God is
Jehovah.”</p>

<p>His prayers have the power to stay the benignant
course of nature. He stands in God’s stead
in this matter. The sober, passionless, unimaginative
James, the brother of our Lord, in his
Epistle, says to us: “See what prayer can do, by
Elijah! Pray as Elijah prayed. Let the righteous
man put forth to its fullest extent the energy
of prayer. Let saints and sinners, angels and
devils, see and feel the mighty potencies of prayer.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
See how the prayer of a good man has power
and influence, and avails with God!”</p>

<p>No sham praying was that of Elijah, no mere
performance, no spiritless, soulless, official praying
was it. Elijah was in Elijah’s praying. The
whole man, with all his fiery forces, was in it.
Almighty God to him was real. Prayer to him
was the means of projecting God in full force on
the world, in order to vindicate His name, establish
His own being, to avenge His blasphemed
name and violated law, and to vindicate His
servants.</p>

<p>Instead of “prayed earnestly,” in James 5:17,
the Revised Version has it, “In his prayer he
prayed,” or “with prayer he prayed.” That is,
with all the combined energies of prayer he
prayed.</p>

<p>Elijah’s praying was strong, insistent, and resistless
in its elements of power. Feeble praying
secures no results and brings neither glory to God
nor good to man.</p>

<p>Elijah learned new and higher lessons of prayer
while hidden away by God and with God when
he was by the brook Cherith. He was doubtless
communing with God while Ahab was searching
all lands for him. After a while he was ordered
to Sarepta, where God had commanded a widow
to sustain him. He went there for the widow’s
good as well as for his own. A benefit to Elijah
and a signal good to the widow were the results<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
of Elijah’s going. While this woman provided
for him, he provided for the woman. Elijah’s
prayers did more for the woman than the woman’s
hospitality did for Elijah. Great trials awaited
the widow and great sorrows too. Her widowhood
and her poverty tell of her struggles and her
sorrows. Elijah was there to relieve her poverty
and to assuage her griefs.</p>

<p>Here is the interesting account:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“And it came to pass that after these things,
the son of the woman, the mistress of the house,
fell sick; and his sickness was sore, that there
was no breath left in him.</p>

<p>“And she said unto Elijah, What have I to do
with thee, O thou man of God? Art thou come
unto me to call my sin to remembrance and to
slay my son?</p>

<p>“And he said unto her, Give me thy son. And
he took him out of her bosom, and carried him
up into a loft, where he abode, and laid him upon
his own bed.</p>

<p>“And he cried unto the Lord, and said, O Lord
my God, hast thou also brought evil upon the
widow with whom I sojourn by slaying her son?</p>

<p>“And he stretched himself upon the child three
times, and cried unto the Lord, and said, O Lord
my God, I pray thee let this child’s soul come
into him again.</p>

<p>“And the Lord heard the voice of Elijah, and
the soul of the child came into him again, and
he revived.</p>

<p>“And Elijah took the child and brought him
down out of the chamber into the house, and delivered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
him unto his mother. And Elijah said,
See, thy son liveth.</p>

<p>“And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this
I know that thou art a man of God, and that the
word of the Lord in thy mouth is truth.”</p>
</div>

<p>Elijah’s prayer enters regions where prayer
had never gone before. The awful, mysterious
and powerful regions of the dead are now invaded
by the presence and demands of prayer. Jesus
Christ refers to Elijah’s going to this widow as
mainly, if not solely, for her good. Elijah’s
presence and praying keep the woman from starving
and brings her son back from death. Surely
no sorrow is like the bitterness of the loss of an
only son. With what assured confidence Elijah
faces the conditions! There is no hesitancy in
his actions, and there is no pause in his faith. He
takes the dead son to his own room, and alone
with God he makes the issue. In that room God
meets him and the struggle is with God alone. The
struggle is too intense and too sacred for companionship
or for spectator. The prayer is made to
God and the issue is with God. The child has
been taken by God, and God rules in the realms
of death. In His hands are the issues of life and
death. Elijah believed that God had taken the
child’s spirit, and that God could as well restore
that spirit. God answered Elijah’s prayer. The
answer was the proof of Elijah’s mission from
God, and of the truth of God’s Word. The dead<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
child brought to life was a sure conviction of this
truth: “Now by this I know that thou art a man
of God, and that the word of the Lord in thy
mouth is truth.” Answers to prayer are the evidences
of the being of God and of the truth of
His Word.</p>

<p>The immortal test of Elijah made in the
presence of an apostate king, and in the face of
a back-slidden nation and an idolatrous priesthood
on Mount Carmel, is a sublime exhibition of faith
and prayer. In the contest the prophets of Baal
had failed. No fire from heaven falls from
heaven in answer to their frantic cries. Elijah,
in great quietness of spirit and with confident
assurance, calls Israel to him. He repairs the
wasted altar of God, the altar of sacrifice and
of prayer, and puts the pieces of the bullock in
order on the altar. He then uses every preventive
against any charge of deception. Everything
is flooded with water. Then Elijah prays a
model prayer, remarkable for its clearness, its
simplicity and its utmost candor. It is noted for
its brevity and its faith.</p>

<p>Read the account given in the Scriptures:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“And it came to pass at the time of the offering
of the evening sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet
came near and said, Lord God of Abraham, Isaac
and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou
art God in Israel, and that I am thy servant, and
that I have done all these things at thy word.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>“Hear me, O Lord, hear me, that this people
may know that thou art the Lord God, and that
thou hast turned their heart back again.</p>

<p>“Then the fire of the Lord fell, and consumed
the burnt sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones,
and the dust, and licked up the water that was in
the trench.</p>

<p>“And when all the people saw it, they fell on
their faces; and they said, The Lord, he is God;
The Lord, he is God.”</p>
</div>

<p>Elijah had been dealing directly with God as
before. True prayer always deals with God.
This prayer of Elijah was to determine the existence
of the true God, and the answer direct from
God settles the question. The answer is also the
credentials of Elijah’s divine mission and the
evidence that God deals with men. If we had
more of Elijah’s praying, marvels would not be
the marvels that they are now to us. God would
not be so strange, so far away in being and so
feeble in action. Everything is tame and feeble
because our praying is so tame and feeble.</p>

<p>God said to Elijah, “Go show thyself to Ahab,
and I will send rain on the earth.” Elijah acted
promptly on the divine order, and showed himself
to Ahab. He had made his issue with Ahab,
Israel and Baal. The whole current of national
feeling had turned back to God. The day was
fading into the evening shades. No rain had come.
But Elijah did not fold his arms and say the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
promise had failed, but gave point and fulfilment
to the promise.</p>

<p>Here is the Scripture record with the result
given:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“And Elijah said unto Ahab, Get thee up, eat
and drink, for there is a sound of abundance of
rain.</p>

<p>“So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And
Elijah went up to the top of Carmel. And he
cast himself down upon the earth, and put his
face between his knees.</p>

<p>“And said to his servant, Go up now, look
toward the sea. And he went up and looked, and
said, There is nothing. And he said, Go again
seven times.</p>

<p>“And it came to pass at the seventh time that
he said, Behold there riseth a little cloud out of
the sea, like a man’s hand. And he said, Go up,
say unto Ahab, Prepare thy chariot, and get thee
down, that the rain stop thee not.</p>

<p>“And it came to pass in the meanwhile, that
the heaven was black with clouds and wind, and
there was a great rain. And Ahab rode and went
to Jezreel.</p>

<p>“And the hand of the Lord was on Elijah.”</p>
</div>

<p>Then it was, as James records, “And he prayed
again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth
brought forth her fruit.”</p>

<p>Elijah’s importunate, fiery praying and God’s
promise brought the rain. Prayer carries the
promise to its gracious fulfillment. It takes persistent
and persevering prayer to give to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
promise its largest and most gracious results. In
this instance it was expectant prayer, watchful of
results, looking for the answer. Elijah had the
answer in the small cloud like a man’s hand. He
had the inward assurance of the answer even before
he had the rain. How Elijah’s praying
shames our feeble praying! His praying brought
things to pass. It vindicated the existence and
being of God, brought conviction to dull and
sluggish consciences, and proved that God was
still God in the nation. Elijah’s praying turned
a whole nation back to God, ordered the moving
of the clouds, and directed the falling of the rain.
It called down fire from heaven to prove the existence
of God or to destroy God’s enemies.</p>

<p>The praying of the Elder Prophet of Israel was
clothed in his robes of fire. The golden crown
was on his head, and his censer was full and fragrant
with the flame, the melody and the perfume
of prayer. What wonderful power clothed him
on this occasion! It was no wonder that Elisha
cried out as he saw this fiery prophet of the Lord
enter the chariot for his heavenly ride, “My
father! my father! The chariot of Israel and the
horsemen thereof!” But chariots and armies
could not begin to do as much for Israel as did
this praying Elijah. Prayers are omnipotent
forces, world-wide and heaven-reaching.</p>

<p>Where are the praying ones of modern times
of fiery faith who can incense Elijah’s prayers?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
We need at this time rulers in the Church who can
add to the force, flame and fragrance of Elijah’s
praying by their own prayers.</p>

<p>Elijah could touch nothing but by prayer.
God was with him mightily because he was mighty
in prayer.</p>

<p>In the contest with the prophets of Baal, he
makes the issue clearly and positively to determine
the true God, as one to be made by prayer.
Does God live? Is the Bible a revelation from
Him? How often in these days are those questions
rising? How often do they need to be settled?
An appeal by prayer is the only settlement
to them. Where is the trouble? Not in God,
but in our praying. The proof of God and of His
being is that He answers prayer. It takes the
faith and prayer of Elijah to settle the question.
Where are the Elijahs in the Church of the present
day? Where are the men of like passions as he,
who can pray as he prayed? We have thousands
of men of like passions, but where are the men
of like praying as he was? Notice with what
calm, assured confidence he stakes the issue and
builds the altar. How calm and pointed is his
prayer on that occasion!</p>

<p>Instead of such praying being out of the range
of New Testament principles and moderation,
this very praying of Elijah is pressed as an example
to be imitated and as an illustration of
what prayer is and what prayer can do when performed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
by the right men in the right way. Elijah’s
results could be secured if we had more Elijah
men to do the praying.</p>

<p>Elijah prayed really, truly and earnestly. How
much of praying there is at the present time which
is not real praying, but is a mere shell, shucks,
and mere words! Much of it might well be
termed non-praying. The world is full of such
praying. It goes nowhere, it avails nothing, it
brings no returns. In fact, no returns nor results
are expected.</p>

<p>The requisites of true prayer are the requisites
of scriptural, vital, personal religion. They are
the requisites of real religious service in this life.
Primary among these requisites is that in serving,
we serve. So in praying, we must pray. Truth
and heart reality, these are the core, the substance,
the sum, the heart of prayer. There are
no possibilities in prayer without we really pray
in all simplicity, reality and trueness. Prayerless
praying—how common, how popular, how delusive
and vain!</p>

<small>HEZEKIAH, THE PRAYING KING</small></h2>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>One can form a habit of study until the will seems to be
at rest and only the intellect is engaged, the will having
retired altogether from exercise. This is not true of
real praying. If the affections are laggard, cold, indifferent,
if the intellect is furnishing no material to clothe
the petition with imagery and fervor, the prayer is a
mere vaporing of intellectual exercise, nothing being accomplished
worth while.</i>—<span class="smcap">Rev. Homer W. Hodge.</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> great religious reformation under King
Hezekiah and the prophet Isaiah was thoroughly
impregnated with prayer in its various stages.
King Hezekiah, of Judah, will serve as an illustration
of a praying elder of God’s Church, white-robed
and gold-crowned. He had genius and
strength, wisdom and piety. He was a statesman,
a general, a poet and a religious reformer.
He is a distinct surprise to us, not so much because
of his strength and genius—they were to be expected—but
in his piety, under all the circumstances
connected with him. The rare statement,
“He did that which was right in the sight of the
Lord,” is a glad and thrilling surprise when we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
consider all his antecedents and his environments.
Where did he come from? Under what circumstances
was his childhood life spent? Who were
his parents and what were their religious character?
Worldliness, half-heartedness and utter
apostasy marked the reign of his father, grandfather
and his great-grandfather. His home surroundings
as he grew up were far from being
favorable to godliness and faith in God. One
thing, however, favored him. He was fortunate
in having Isaiah for his friend and counselor when
he assumed the crown of Judah. How much there
is in a ruler’s having a God-fearing man for a
counselor and an associate!</p>

<p>With what familiar and successful praying did
he intercede with God is seen in the Passover
feast, in which a number of the people were unfitted
to participate. They had not prepared
themselves by the required ceremonial cleansing,
and it was important that they be allowed to eat
the Passover feast with all the others.</p>

<p>Here is the brief account with special reference
to the praying of Hezekiah and the result:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“For there were many in the congregation that
were not sanctified; therefore the Levites had the
charge of the killing of the passover for every
one that was not clean, to sanctify them unto the
Lord.</p>

<p>“For a multitude of the people had not
cleansed themselves yet did they eat the passover
otherwise than it was written. But Hezekiah<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
prayed for them saying, The Good Lord
pardon every one.</p>

<p>“That prepareth his heart to seek God, the
Lord God of his fathers, though he be not
cleansed according to the purification of the
sanctuary.</p>

<p>“And the Lord hearkened to Hezekiah, and
healed the people.”</p>
</div>

<p>So the Lord heard him as he prayed, and even
the violation of the most sacred law of the Passover
was forgiven in answer to the prayer of this
praying, God-fearing king. Law must yield its
scepter to prayer.</p>

<p>The strength, directness and foundation of his
faith and prayer are found in his words to his
army. Memorable words are they, stronger and
mightier than all the hosts of Sennacherib:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Be strong and courageous; be not afraid nor
dismayed for the king of Assyria, nor for all the
multitude that is with him; for there be more
with us than with him.</p>

<p>“With him is an arm of flesh; but with us is
the Lord our God to help us, and to fight our
battles. And the people rested themselves upon
the words of Hezekiah, king of Judah.”</p>
</div>

<p>His defense against the mighty enemies of God
was prayer. His enemies quailed and were destroyed
by his prayers when his own armies were
powerless. God’s people were always safe when
their princes were princes in prayer.</p>

<p>An occasion of serious import came to the people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
of God during his reign which was to test his
faith in God and furnish opportunity to try the
prayer agency to obtain deliverance. Judah was
sorely pressed by the Assyrians, and, humanly
speaking, defeat and captivity seemed imminent.
The King of Assyria sent a commission to defy
and blaspheme the name of God and to insult
King Hezekiah, and they uttered their insults and
blasphemy publicly. Note what Hezekiah immediately
did without hesitation:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“And it came to pass when King Hezekiah
heard it, that he rent his clothes and covered
himself with sackcloth, and went into the house
of the Lord.”</p>
</div>

<p>His very first impression was to turn to God
by going to the “house of prayer.” God was in
his thoughts, and prayer was the first thing to
be done. And so he sent messengers to Isaiah
to join him in prayer. In such an emergency God
must not be left out of the account. God must
be appealed to for deliverance from these
blasphemous enemies of God and His people.</p>

<p>Just at this particular juncture the forces of
the King of Assyria, which were besieging Hezekiah,
were diverted from an immediate attack
on Jerusalem. The King of Assyria, however,
sent to Hezekiah a defaming and blasphemous
letter.</p>

<p>For the second time, as he is insulted and beset
by the forces of this heathen king, he enters the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
house of the Lord, the “house of prayer.” Where
else should he go? And to whom should he appeal
but unto the God of Israel?</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“And Hezekiah received the letter from the
hand of the messengers, and read it; and Hezekiah
went up to the house of the Lord, and
spread it before the Lord.</p>

<p>“And Hezekiah prayed unto the Lord: O
Lord of hosts, the God of Israel that dwellest
between the cherubim, Thou art the God, even
thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth.
Thou hast made heaven and earth.</p>

<p>“Now, therefore, O Lord our God, save us
from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth
may know that thou art the Lord, even thou
only.”</p>
</div>

<p>And note the speedy answer and the marvelous
results of such praying by this God-fearing king.
First, Isaiah gave the King full assurance that he
need fear nothing. God had heard the prayer,
and would give a great deliverance.</p>

<p>Then secondly, the angel of the Lord came
with swift wings and smote 185,000 Assyrians.
The king was vindicated, God was honored, and
the people of God were saved.</p>

<p>The united prayers of the praying king and of
the praying prophet were almighty forces in bringing
deliverance and destroying God’s enemies.
Armies lay at their mercy, defenceless; and
angels, swift-winged and armed with almighty
power and vengeance, were their allies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>Hezekiah had ministered in prayer in destroying
idolatry and in reforming his kingdom. In
meeting his enemies, prayer had been his chief
weapon. He now comes to try its efficiency
against the set and declared purposes of Almighty
God. Will it avail in this new field of action?
Let us see. Hezekiah was very sick, and God
sends his own familiar friend and wise counselor
and prophet, Isaiah, to warn him of his approaching
end, and to tell him to arrange all his affairs
for his final departure. This is the Scriptural
statement:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death.
And the Prophet Isaiah, the son of Amoz, came
to him, and said unto him, Thus saith the Lord:
Set thy house in order, for thou shalt die and
not live.”</p>
</div>

<p>The decree came direct from God that he
should die. What can set aside or reverse that
Divine decree of heaven? Hezekiah had never
been in a condition so insuperable with a decree
so direct and definite from God. Can prayer
change the purposes of God? Can prayer snatch
from the jaws of death one who has been decreed
to die? Can prayer save a man from an incurable
sickness? These were the questions with which
his faith had now to deal. But his faith does
not seem to pause one moment. His faith is not
staggered one minute at the sudden and definite
news conveyed to him by the Lord’s prophet. No<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
such questions which modern unbelief or disbelief
would raise are started in his mind. At once he
gives himself to prayer. Immediately without
delay he applies to God who issued the edict. To
whom else could he go? Cannot God change His
own purposes if He chooses?</p>

<p>Note what Hezekiah did in this emergency,
sorely pressed, and see the gracious result:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Then he turned his face to the wall and
prayed unto the Lord, saying,</p>

<p>“I beseech thee, O Lord, remember now how
I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect
heart, and have done that which is good in
thy sight. And Hezekiah wept sore.”</p>
</div>

<p>It was no self-righteous plea which he offered
to God for recovery. He was only pleading his
fidelity, just as Christ did in after years:</p>

<p>“Father, I have glorified thee on earth.” He
is the Lord’s reminder, and is putting Him in
mind as to his sincerity, fidelity and service, which
was in every way legitimate. This prayer was
directly in line with that of David in Psalm 26:1,
“Judge me, O Lord, for I have walked in my
integrity.” This is not a prayer test with Hezekiah,
nor is it a faith cure, but it is a testing of
God. It must be God’s cure if a cure comes at all.</p>

<p>Hezekiah had hardly finished his prayer, and
Isaiah was just about to go home when God gave
him another message for Hezekiah, this time one
more pleasant and encouraging. The mighty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
force of prayer had affected God, and had changed
His edict and reversed Him in His purpose concerning
Hezekiah. What is that which prayer
cannot do? What is it which a praying man
cannot accomplish through prayer?</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“And it came to pass before Isaiah had gone
out into the middle court, that the word of the
Lord came to him, saying,</p>

<p>“Turn again, and tell Hezekiah, the captain
of my people, Thus, saith the Lord, the God of
David thy father, I have heard thy prayer; I
have seen thy tears; Behold, I will heal thee; on
the third day thou shalt go up to the house of the
Lord.</p>

<p>“And I will add unto thy days fifteen years,
and I will deliver thee and this city out of the
hand of the King of Assyria; and I will defend
this city for my own sake, and for David, my
servant’s sake.”</p>
</div>

<p>The prayer was to God. It was that God should
reconsider and change His mind. Doubtless
Isaiah returned to his house with a lighter heart
than he did when he delivered his original message.
God had been prayed to by this sick king,
and had been asked to revoke His decree, and
God had condescended to grant the request. God
sometimes changes His mind. He has a right to
do so. The reasons for Him to change His mind
are strong reasons. His servant Hezekiah wants
it done. Hezekiah had been a dutiful servant and
had done much for God. Truth, perfection and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
goodness have been the elements of Hezekiah’s
service and the rule of his life. Hezekiah’s tears
and prayer are in the way of God’s executing
His decree to take away the life of His servant.
Prayer and tears are mighty things with God.
They are to Him much more than consistency and
much more to Him than decrees. “I have heard
thy prayer; I have seen thy tears; behold I will
heal thee.”</p>

<p>Sickness dies before prayer. Health comes in
answer to prayer. God answered more than
Hezekiah asked for. Hezekiah prayed only for
his life, and God gave him life, and in addition
promised him protection and security from his
enemies.</p>

<p>But Isaiah had something to do with the recovery
of this praying king. There was something
more than prayer in it. Isaiah’s praying was
changed into the skill of the physician. “And
Isaiah said, Take a lump of figs. And they took
and laid it on the boil, and he recovered.”</p>

<p>God often uses remedies in answering prayer.
It frequently takes a stronger faith to rise above
means and not to trust in them, than it does to
wholly reject all means. Here was a simple
remedy that all might know that it did not cure
the deadly disease, and yet a means to aid or to
test faith. But still more praying was to be done.
Isaiah and Hezekiah could not do things without
much praying:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>“And Hezekiah said unto Isaiah, What shall
be the sign that the Lord will heal me, and that
I shall go up into the house of the Lord the third
day?</p>

<p>“And Isaiah said, This sign shalt thou have of
the Lord, that the Lord will do the thing that he
hath spoken: Shall the shadow go forward ten
degrees, or go back ten degrees?</p>

<p>“And Hezekiah answered, It is a light thing
for the shadow to go down ten degrees; nay, but
let the shadow return backward ten degrees.</p>

<p>“And Isaiah the prophet cried unto the Lord,
and he brought the shadow ten degrees backward,
by which it had gone down in the dial of Ahaz.”</p>
</div>

<p>Hezekiah meets the occasion and covers the
answer to his prayer with thanksgiving. The
fragrance of the sweet spices are there, and the
melody of the harp also.</p>

<p>Four things let us ever keep in mind: God
hears prayer, God heeds prayer, God answers
prayer, and God delivers by prayer. These things
cannot be too often repeated. Prayer breaks all
bars, dissolves all chains, opens all prisons and
widens all straits by which God’s saints have been
holden.</p>

<p>Life was sweet to Hezekiah and he desired to
live, but what can brook God’s decree? Nothing
but the energy of faith. Hezekiah’s heart was
broken under the strain, and its waters flowed
and added force and volume to his praying. He
pleaded with great strivings and with strong arguments;
and God heard Hezekiah praying, saw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
his tears, and changed his mind, and Hezekiah
lived to praise God and to be an example of the
power of mighty praying.</p>

<p>Like Hezekiah, the decent, soulless way of
praying did not suit Paul. He puts himself in the
attitude of a wrestler, and charges his brethren to
join him in the agony of a great conflict. “Brethren,
I beseech you,” he says, “for the Lord Jesus
Christ’s sake, and for the love of the Spirit, that
ye strive together with me in your prayers to God
for me.” He was too much in earnest to touch
the praying business genteelly or with gloved
hands. He was in it as an agony, and he desired
his brethren to be his partners in this conflict and
wrestling of his soul. Epaphras was doing this
same kind of praying for the Colossians: “Always
laboring fervently for you in prayers, that ye
may stand perfect and complete in all the will
of God.” An end worth agonizing for always.
This kind of praying by these early pastors of the
Apostolic Church was one secret of the purity,
one source of the power of the Church. And
this was the kind of praying which was done by
Hezekiah.</p>

<p>Here was prayer born in the fire of a great
desire, and pursued through the deepest agony
of conflict and opposition to success. Our spiritual
cravings are not strong enough to give
life to the mighty conflicts of prayer? They are
not absorbing enough to stop business, arrest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
worldly pursuits, awaken us before day, and send
us to the closet, to solitude, and to God; to conquer
every opposing force and win our victories
from the very jaws of hell. We want preachers
and men and women who can illustrate the uses,
the forces, the blessing, and the utmost limits of
prayer.</p>

<p>Isaiah laments that there was no one who
stirred himself up to take hold of God. Much
praying was done, but it was too easy, indifferent,
complacent. There were no mighty movements
of the soul toward God, no array of all
the sanctified energies to reach out and grapple
God and draw out his treasures for spiritual uses.
Forceless prayers have no power to overcome
difficulties, no power to win marked results, or
gain a complete and wonderful victory.</p>

<small>EZRA, THE PRAYING REFORMER</small></h2>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Before the Great War there were many signs of a new
interest in</i> <span class="smcap">Prayer</span> <i>and new hope from its exercise. How
these signs have multiplied is known to every one. This
one thing at least that is good the War has done for us
already. Let us not miss our opportunity. Prayer is not
an easy exercise. It requires encouragement, exposition,
and training. There never was a time when men and
women were more sincerely anxious to be told how to
pray. Prayer is the mightiest instrument in our armory,
and if we are to use it as God has given the encouragement,
we must do everything in our power to bring it
into exercise.</i>—<span class="smcap">Rev. James Hastings.</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Ezra</span>, the priest, and one of God’s great reformers,
comes before us in the Old Testament
as a praying man, one who uses prayer to overcome
difficulties and bring good things to pass.
He had returned from Babylon under the patronage
of the King of Babylon, who had been strangely
moved toward Ezra and who favored him in
many ways. Ezra had been in Jerusalem but a
few days when the princes came to him with the
distressing information that the people had not
separated themselves from the people of that
country, and were doing according to the abominations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
of the heathen nations about them. And
that which was worse than all was that the princes
and rulers in Israel had been chief in the trespass.</p>

<p>It was a sad state of affairs facing Ezra as
he found the Church almost hopelessly involved
with the world. God demands of His Church
in all ages that it should be separated from the
world, a separation so sharp that it amounts to
an antagonism. To effect this very end, He put
Israel in the Promised Land, and cut them off
from other nations by mountains, deserts and seas,
and straightway charged them that they should
not form any relation with alien nations, neither
marital, social nor business.</p>

<p>But Ezra finds the Church at Jerusalem, as he
returns from Babylon, paralyzed and hopelessly
and thoroughly prostrated by the violation of
this principle. They had intermarried, and had
formed the closest and most sacred ties in family,
social and business life, with the Gentile nations.
All were involved in it, priests, Levites, princes
and people. The family, the business, and the
religious life of the people was founded in this
violation of God’s law. What was to be done?
What could be done? Here were the important
questions which faced this leader in Israel, this
man of God.</p>

<p>Everything appeared to be against the recovery
of the Church. Ezra could not preach to them,
because the whole city would be inflamed, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
would hound him out of the place. What force
was there which could recover them to God so
that they would dissolve business partnerships,
divorce wives and husbands, cut acquaintances and
dissolve friendships?</p>

<p>The first thing about Ezra which is worthy of
remark was that he saw the situation and realized
how serious it was. He was not a blind-eyed
optimist who never sees anything wrong in the
Church. By the mouth of Isaiah God had propounded
the very pertinent question, “Who is
blind but my servant?” But it could not possibly
be made to apply to Ezra. Nor did he minimize
the condition of things or seek to palliate the sins
of the people or to minimize the enormity of
their crimes. Their offense appeared in his eyes
to be serious in the extreme. It is worth not a
little to have leaders in Zion who have eyes to
see the sins of the Church as well as the evils of
the times. One great need of the modern Church
is for leaders after the style of Ezra, who are
not blind in their seeing department, and who
are willing to see the state of things in the Church
and who are not reluctant to open their eyes to
the real situation.</p>

<p>Very naturally, seeing these dreadful evils in
the Church and in the society of Jerusalem, he
was distressed. The sad condition of things
grieved him, so much so that he rent his garments,
plucked his hair, and sat down astonished. All<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
these things are evidences of his great distress
of soul at the terrible state of affairs. Then it
was in that frame of mind, concerned, solicitous
and troubled in soul, that he gave himself to
prayer, to confession of the sins of the people,
and to pleading for pardoning mercy at the hands
of God. To whom should he go in a time like
this but unto the God who hears prayer, who
is ready to pardon and who can bring the unexpected
thing to pass?</p>

<p>He was amazed beyond expression at the
wicked conduct of the people, was deeply moved
and began to fast and pray. Prayer and fasting
always accomplish something. He prays with
a broken heart, for there is naught else that he
can do. He prays unto God, deeply burdened,
prostrate on the ground and weeping, while the
whole city unites with him in prayer.</p>

<p>Prayer was the only way to placate God, and
Ezra became a great mover in a great work for
God, with marvelous results. The whole work,
its principles and its results, are summarized by
just one verse in Ezra 10:1:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Now when Ezra had prayed, and had confessed,
weeping and casting himself down before
the house of God, there assembled unto him out
of Israel a very great congregation of men and
women and children, for the people wept sore.”</p>
</div>

<p>There had been mighty, simple and persevering
prayer. Intense and prevailing prayer had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
accomplished its end. Ezra’s praying had brought
into being and brought forth results in a great
work for God. It was mighty praying because
it brought Almighty God to do His own work,
which was absolutely hopeless from any other
source save by prayer and by God. But nothing
is hopeless to prayer because nothing is hopelessly
to God.</p>

<p>Again we must say that prayer has only to do
with God, and is only resultful as it has to do
with God. Whatever influence the praying of
Ezra had upon himself, its chief, if not its only,
results followed because it affected God, and
moved Him to do the work.</p>

<p>A great and general repentance followed this
praying of Ezra, and there occurred a wonderful
reformation in Israel. And Ezra’s mourning and
his praying were the great factors which had to
do with bringing these great things to pass.</p>

<p>So thorough was the revival which occurred
that as evidences of its genuineness it is noted
that the leaders in Israel came to Ezra with these
words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We have trespassed against our God, and
have taken strange wives of the people of the
land. Yet now there is hope in Israel concerning
this thing.</p>

<p>“Now therefore let us make a covenant with
our God to put away all the wives, and such as
are born to them, according to the counsel of my
lord, and of those that tremble at the commandment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
of our God; and let it be done according
to the law.</p>

<p>“Arise, for this matter belongeth unto thee.
We also will be with thee; be of good courage,
and do it.”</p>

<small>NEHEMIAH, THE PRAYING BUILDER</small></h2>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>We care not for your splendid abilities as a minister,
or your natural endowment as an orator before men. We
are sure that the truth of the matter is this: No one will
or can command success and become a real praying soul
unless intense application is the price. I am even now
convinced that the difference between the saints like
Wesley, Fletcher, Edwards, Brainerd, Bramwell, Bounds,
and ourselves is energy, perseverance, invincible determination
to succeed or die in the attempt. God help
us.</i>—<span class="smcap">Rev. Homer W. Hodge.</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> enumerating the praying saints of the Old
Testament, we must not leave out of that sacred
catalogue Nehemiah, the builder. He stands out
on an equal footing with the others who have
been considered. In the story of the reconstruction
of Jerusalem after the captivity, he plays a
prominent part, and prayer is prominent in his
life during those years. He was a captive in
Babylon, and had an important position in the
palace of the king to whom he was cup bearer.
There must have been considerable merit in him
to cause the king to take a Hebrew captive and
place him in such an office, where he really had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
the life of the king in his charge, because he was
responsible for the wine which he drank.</p>

<p>It was while Nehemiah was in Babylon, in the
king’s palace, that one day his brethren came
from Jerusalem, and very naturally Nehemiah
desired news from the people there and information
concerning the city itself. The distressing
information was given him that the walls were
broken down, the gates were burned with fire,
and the remnant who were left there at the beginning
of the captivity were in great affliction
and reproach.</p>

<p>Just one verse gives the effect of this sad news
upon this man of God:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“And it came to pass when I heard these words,
that I sat down and wept, and mourned certain
days and fasted, and prayed before the God of
heaven.”</p>
</div>

<p>Here was a man whose heart was in his own
native land far away from where he now lived.
He loved Israel, was concerned for the welfare
of Zion, and was true to God. Deeply distressed
by the information concerning his brethren at
Jerusalem, he mourned and wept. How few the
strong men in these days who can weep at the
evils and abominations of the times! How rare
those who, seeing the desolations of Zion, are
sufficiently interested and concerned for the welfare
of the Church to mourn! Mourning and
weeping over the decay of religion, the decline<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
of revival power, and the fearful inroads of
worldliness in the Church are almost an unknown
quantity. There is so much of so-called optimism
that leaders have no eyes to see the breaking
down of the walls of Zion and the low spiritual
state of the Christians of the present day, and
have less heart to mourn and cry about it.
Nehemiah was a mourner in Zion. And possessing
this state of heart, distressed beyond measure,
he does that which other praying saints had done—he
goes to God and makes it a subject of prayer.
The prayer is recorded in Nehemiah, 1st chapter,
and is a model after which to pattern our prayers.
He begins with adoration, makes confession of
the sins of his nation, pleads the promises of
God, mentions former mercies, and begs for pardoning
mercy. Then with an eye to the future—for
unquestionably he had planned, the next time
he was summoned into the King’s presence, to ask
permission to visit Jerusalem and to do there what
was possible to remedy the distressing state of
affairs—we hear him pray for something very
special: “And prosper thy servant this day, I
pray thee, and grant him mercy in the sight of
this man. For,” he adds by way of explanation,
“I was the king’s cup bearer.”</p>

<p>It seemed all right to pray for his people, but
how was a heathen king, with possibly no sympathy
whatever for the sad condition of his city
and his people in a captive land, and who had no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
interest in the matter, to be so favorably affected
that he would consent to give up his faithful cup
bearer and allow him to be gone for months?
But Nehemiah believed in a God who could touch
even the mind of a heathen ruler and move him
favorably toward the request of his praying
servant.</p>

<p>Nehemiah was summoned into the king’s presence,
and God used even the appearance of
Nehemiah’s countenance as an entering wedge to
gain the consent of Artaxerxes. This started the
inquiry of the king as to its cause, and the final
result was that the king not only permitted Nehemiah
to go back to Jerusalem but furnished him
with everything needful for the journey and for
the success of the enterprise.</p>

<p>Nor did Nehemiah rest his case when he first
prayed about this matter, but he stated this significant
fact as he was talking to the king: “So I
prayed unto the God of heaven?” leading out the
impression that while the king was inquiring about
his request and the length of time he would be
gone, he was then and there talking to God about
the matter.</p>

<p>The intense, persistent praying of Nehemiah
prevailed. God can even affect the mind of a
heathen ruler, and this he can do in answer to
prayer without in the least overturning his free
agency or forcing his will. It was a parallel case
with that of Esther when she called upon her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
people to fast and pray for her as she went uninvited
into the king’s presence. As a result, his
mind at a very critical moment was touched by
the Spirit of God, and he was favorably moved
toward Esther and held out to her the golden
scepter.</p>

<p>Nor did the praying of Nehemiah cease when
he had succeeded thus far. In building the wall
of Jerusalem, he met with great opposition from
Sanballat and Tobiah, who ridiculed the efforts
of the people to rebuild the city’s walls. Unmoved
by these revilings and the intense opposition of
these wicked opponents of that which was for
God’s cause, he pursued the task which he had
undertaken. But he mixes prayer with all he does:
“Hear, O our God, for we are despised; and turn
their reproach upon their own head, and give
them for a prey in the land of our captivity.”
And in continuing the account he says, “Nevertheless
we made our prayer unto our God.”</p>

<p>All along in the accounts of the high and noble
work he was doing, we find prayer comes out
prominently to the front. Even after the walls
were completed, these same enemies of his and
of the people of God again opposed him in his
task. But he renews his praying, and he himself
records this significant prayer: “Now there, O
God, strengthen my hands.”</p>

<p>Still further on, when Sanballat and Tobiah had
hired an emissary to frighten and hinder Nehemiah,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
we find him setting himself directly against
this new attack, and then again he turns to God
in prayer: “My God, think thou upon Tobiah
and Sanballat according to these their works and
on the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the
prophets, that would have put me in fear.” And
God answered his faithful laborer, and defeated
the counsels and the plans of these wicked opponents
of Israel.</p>

<p>Nehemiah discovered to his dismay that the
portions of the Levites had not been given them,
and as a result the house of God was forsaken.
He took steps to see that the lawful tithes were
forthcoming so that God’s house should be opened
to all religious services, and appointed treasurers
to give attention to this business. But prayer
must not be overlooked, so we find his prayer
recorded at this time: “Remember me, O my
God, concerning this, and wipe not out my good
deeds that I have done for the house of my God,
and for the offices thereof.”</p>

<p>Let it not be thought that this was the plea
of self-righteousness as was that of the Pharisee
in our Lord’s time who professedly went up to
the temple to pray, who paraded his self-righteous
claims in God’s sight. It was a prayer after the
fashion of Hezekiah, who reminded God of his
fidelity to Him and of his heart’s being right in
his sight.</p>

<p>Once more Nehemiah finds evil among the people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
of God. Just as he corrected the evil which
caused the closing of the house of God, he discovers
practices of Sabbath breaking, and here he
has not only to counsel the people and seek to
correct them by mild means, but he proposes to
exercise his authority if they did not cease their
buying and selling on the Sabbath Day. But he
must close this part of his work also with prayer,
and so he records his prayer on that occasion:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Remember me, O my God, concerning this
also, and spare me according to the greatness of
thy mercy.”</p>
</div>

<p>Lastly, as a reformer, he discovers another
great evil among the people. They had intermarried
with the men and women of Ashdod,
Ammon and Moab. Contending with them, he
caused them to reform in this matter, and the
close of his record has a prayer in it:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Remember me, O my God, because they have
defiled the priesthood, and the covenant of the
priesthood, and of the Levites.”</p>
</div>

<p>Cleansing them from all strangers, he appointed
the wards of the priests, and the Levites, and his
recorded career closes with this brief prayer: “Remember
me, O my God, for good.”</p>

<p>Fortunate is that Church whose leaders are
men of prayer. Happy is that congregation who
are contemplating the erection of a church to
have leaders who will lay its foundations in prayer,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
and whose walls go up side by side with prayer.
Prayer helps to build churches and to erect the
walls of houses of worship. Prayer defeats the
opponents of those who are prosecuting God’s
enterprises. Prayer touches favorably the minds
even of those not connected with the Church, and
moves them toward Church matters. Prayer helps
mightily in all matters concerning God’s cause and
wonderfully aids and encourages the hearts of
those who have His work in hand in this world.</p>

<small>SAMUEL, THE CHILD OF PRAYER</small></h2>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>That was a grand action by Jerome, one of the Roman
fathers. He laid aside all pressing engagements and
went to fulfill the call God gave him, viz., to translate
the Holy Scriptures. His congregations were larger than
many preachers of to-day but he said to his people,
“Now it is necessary that the Scriptures be translated;
you must find you another minister: I am bound for
the wilderness and shall not return until my task is
finished.” Away he went and labored and prayed until
he produced the Latin Vulgate which will last as long
as the world stands. So we must say to our friends, “I
must away and have time for prayer and solitude.” And
though we did not write Latin Vulgates yet our work will
be immortal: Glory to God.</i>—<span class="smcap">Rev. C. H. Spurgeon.</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Samuel</span> came into this world and was given
existence in direct answer to prayer. He was born
of a praying mother, whose heart was full of
earnest desire for a son. He came into life under
prayer surroundings, and his first months in this
world were spent in direct contact with a woman
who knew how to pray. It was a prayer accompanied
by a solemn vow that if he should be given,
he should be “lent unto the Lord,” and true to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
that vow, this praying mother put him directly
in touch with the minister of the sanctuary and
under the influence of “the house of prayer.” It
was no wonder he developed into a man of prayer.
We could not have expected otherwise with such
a beginning in life and with such early environments.
Such surroundings always make impressions
upon children and tend to make character
and determine destiny.</p>

<p>He was in a favorable place to hear God when
He spoke to him, and was in an atmosphere where
it tended to his heeding the divine call which
came to him. It was the most natural thing in
the world when at the third call from heaven,
when he recognized God’s voice, that his childish
heart responded so promptly, “Speak, Lord, thy
servant heareth.” Quickly was there a response
from his boyish spirit, of submission, willingness
and prayer.</p>

<p>Had he been born of a different sort of
mother, had he been placed under different surroundings,
had he spent his early days in contact
with different influences, does any one for one moment
suppose he could have easily heard the voice
of God calling him to His service, and that he
would have so readily yielded his young life to
the God who brought him into being? Would a
worldly home, with worldly surroundings, separated
from the Church of God, with a worldly-minded
mother, have produced such a character<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
as Samuel? It takes such influences and agencies
in early life to produce such praying men as Samuel.
Would you have your child called early into
divine service and separated from the world unto
God? Would you have him so situated that he
will be called in childhood by the Spirit of God?
Put him under prayer influences. Place him near
to and directly under the influence of the Man
of God and in close touch with that house which
is called “the house of prayer.”</p>

<p>Samuel knew God in boyhood. As a consequence
he knew God in manhood. He recognized
God in childhood, obeyed him and prayed unto
him. The result was that he recognized God in
manhood, obeyed him, and prayed unto him. If
more children were born of praying mothers,
brought up in direct contact with “the house of
prayer,” and reared under prayer environments,
more children would hear the voice of God’s spirit
speaking to them, and would more quickly respond
to those divine calls to a religious life. Would
we have praying men in our churches? We must
have praying mothers to give them birth, praying
homes to color their lives, and praying surroundings
to impress their minds and to lay the foundations
for praying lives. Praying Samuels come
from praying Hannahs. Praying priests come
from “the house of prayer.” Praying leaders
come from praying homes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>Israel for years had been under bondage to the
Philistines and the ark was housed in the home
of Abinadab, whose son Eleazer was appointed
to keep this sacred testimony of God. The people
had gone into idolatry and Samuel was disturbed
about the religious condition of the nation. The
ark of God was absent, the people were given to
the worship of idols, and there had been a grievous
departure from God. Calling upon them to
put away their strange gods, he urged them to
prepare their hearts unto the Lord and to begin
again to serve Him—promising them that the
Lord would deliver them out of the hands of the
Philistines. His preaching thus plainly to them,
for with all else belonging to him, Samuel was a
preacher of the times, made a deep impression
and bore rich fruits as such preaching always does.
“Then the children of Israel did put away Baalim
and Ashtoreth, and served the Lord only.”</p>

<p>But this was not enough. Prayer must be mixed
with and must accompany their reformation. So
Samuel, true to his convictions about prayer, says
to the people, “Gather all Israel to Mizpeh, and
I will pray for you unto the Lord.” While Samuel
was offering up prayer for these wicked
Israelites, the Philistines drew near to battle
against the nation, but the Lord intervened at the
critical moment and thundered with a great thunder,
and discomfited these enemies of Israel, “and
they were smitten before Israel.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>The nation fortunately had a man who could
pray, who knew the place and the worth of prayer,
and a leader who had the ear of God and who
could influence God.</p>

<p>But Samuel’s praying did not stop there. He
judged Israel all the days of his life, and had
occasion from year to year to go in circuit to
Bethel, Gilgal and Mizpeh. Then he returned
home to Ramah, where he resided. “And there
he built an altar unto the Lord.” Here was an
altar of sacrifice but as well was it an altar of
prayer. And while it may have been for the benefit
of the community where he lived, after the fashion
of a town church, yet it must not be overlooked
that it must have been a family altar, a place
where the sacrifice for sin was offered but at the
same time where his household gathered for worship,
praise and prayer. Here Almighty God
was acknowledged in the home, here was the advertisement
of a religious home, and here father
and mother called upon the name of the Lord,
differentiating this home from all the worldly and
idolatrous homes about them.</p>

<p>Here is an example of a religious home, the
kind so greatly needed in this irreligious, godless
age. Blessed is that home which has in it an
altar of sacrifice and of prayer, where daily thanksgivings
ascend to heaven and where morning and
night praying is done.</p>

<p>Samuel was not only a praying priest, a praying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
leader and a praying teacher and leader, but he
was a praying father. And any one who knows
the situation so far as family religion is concerned
knows full well that the great demand of these
modern times is religious homes and praying
fathers and mothers. Here is where the breakdown
in religion occurs, where the religious life
of a community first begins to decay, and where
we must go first to beget praying men and women
in the Church of God. It is in the home that the
revival must commence.</p>

<p>A crisis came in the history of this nation. The
people were infatuated by the glory of a kingdom
with a human king, and was prepared to reject
God as their king, as He had always been. So
they came to Samuel with the bold request, “Make
us a king to judge us like all the nations.” The
thing displeased this man of God, who was jealous
for the name, the honor and the pleasure of the
Lord God. How could it be otherwise? Who
would not have been likewise displeased if he
were built after the pattern of Samuel? It grieved
him in soul. The Lord, however, came to him
just at that time with the comforting assurance
so far as he was personally concerned in the transaction,
that “they have not rejected thee, but they
have rejected me, that I should not reign over
them. Hearken unto the voice of the people, in
all that they say unto thee.”</p>

<p>Then it was that Samuel followed the bent of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
his mind, “And Samuel prayed unto the Lord.”
It seemed that in every matter concerning this
people, with which Samuel was connected, he must
pray over it. How much more now when there
was to be an entire revolution in the form of
government, and God was to be displaced as the
ruler of the people, and a human king was to be
set up? National affairs need to be prayed over.
Praying men are demanded to carry to God in
prayer the affairs of government. Lawmakers,
law judges, and law executives need leaders in
Israel to pray for them. How much fewer the
mistakes if there was more praying done in civil
matters?</p>

<p>But this was not to be the end of this matter.
God must show so definitely and plainly His displeasure
at such a request as had been made for a
human king, that the people might know what a
wicked thing they had done, even though God
acceded to their request. They must know God
still existed and had to do with this people, and
with their king and the affairs of the government.
So the prayers of Samuel must again be
brought into play to carry out the divine purposes.
So Samuel called upon the people to stand still,
and he would show them what the Lord would
do before their eyes. So he called upon God, and
in answer God sent a tremendous storm of thunder
and rain, which exceedingly terrified the people,
and caused them to acknowledge their great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
sin in asking for a king. So afraid were the people
that they hastily called upon Samuel to pray for
them and to spare them from what seemed to be
destruction. Samuel again prayed, and God heard
and answered, and the thunder and rain ceased.</p>

<p>One more incident in the prayer life of Samuel
is worth noticing. King Saul had been ordered
to destroy all the Amalekites, root and branch,
and all their stuff, but Saul, contrary to divine
instructions, had spared King Agag and the best
of the sheep and the cattle, and had justified it
because he claimed that the people wanted it done.</p>

<p>God brought this message to Samuel at this
time:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be
king; for he is turned back from following me,
and hath not performed my commandments.”</p>
</div>

<p>“And it grieved Samuel, and he cried all night
unto the Lord.” Such a sudden declaration was
enough to produce grief of soul in a man like
Samuel, who loved his nation, who was true to
God, and who above everything else desired the
prosperity of Zion. Such grief of soul over the
evils of the Church and at the sight of the abominations
of the times always drives a man to
his knees in prayer. Of course Samuel carried
the case to God. It was a time for prayer. The
case was too serious for him not to be deeply
moved to pray. So greatly was the inner soul of
Samuel disturbed that he prayed all night about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
it. Too much was at stake for him to shut his
eyes to the affair, to treat it indifferently, and
to let it pass without taking God into the matter,
for the future welfare of Israel was in the balance.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br>

<small>DANIEL, THE PRAYING CAPTIVE</small></h2>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>It is a wonderful historical fact that the men of
prayer have always been the men of power in the world.
I want to convince you about this. Some of you men—and
I am glad to see such a large number of men here
to-night—if you are arguing with some friend in the
workshop, be sure and ask him why it is that the men of
power in the world have been the men of prayer. Take
only one instance: Where did they go always to find
men for the forlorn hope in Havelock’s days? They
went to Havelock’s prayer meeting; that is where they
found men who had courage to come out for the forlorn
hope.</i>—<span class="smcap">Bishop Winnington Ingram.</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">That</span> was a notable experience in the life of
Daniel when he was ordered by the king while
in Babylon not to ask any petition of any God or
king for thirty days, under penalty of being cast
into the lions’ den. He paid no attention to the
edict, for it is recorded, “Now when Daniel knew
that the writing was signed, he went into his
house, and his windows being opened in his chamber
toward Jerusalem, he kneeled upon his knees
three times a day, and prayed and gave thanks
before his God, as he did aforetime.” Do not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
forget that this was the regular habit of this man
of God. “He kneeled upon his knees and prayed
as he did aforetime.” What was the result? Just
as expected. God sent an angel into the den of
lions with Daniel and locked their mouths so
that not a hair on his head was touched, and
he was wonderfully delivered. Even so to-day
deliverance always come to God’s saints who tread
the path of prayer as the saints of old did.</p>

<p>Daniel did not forget his God while in a foreign
land, away from the house of God and its religious
services, and deprived as he was of many religious
privileges. He was a striking illustration of a
young man who was decidedly religious under the
most unfavorable surroundings. He proved conclusively
that one could be definitely a servant of
God though his environments were anything else
than religious. He was among heathens so far as
a God-fearing nation was concerned. There was
no temple worship, no Sabbath Day, no Word of
God to be read. But he had one help there which
remained with him, and of which he could not
be deprived, and that was his secret prayers.</p>

<p>Purposing in his heart without debating the
question one moment or compromising at any one
point, that he would not eat of the king’s meat
nor drink the king’s wine, he stood out in that
ungodly country a striking illustration of a young
man, fearing God first of all, and resolving to be
religious, cost what it may. But he was not to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
have a flowery bed on which to rest nor a smooth
road on which to travel. The whimsical, tyrannical
and unreasonable king, Nebuchadnezzar,
was to put him to the test, and his praying qualities
were to be proved. This king had a strange
dream, the particular items of which passed from
his memory, but the fact of the dream remained.
So troubled was he about the dream, he called
for all the soothsayers, astrologers and sorcerers
to call the dream to mind, an impossible task,
humanly speaking, and then to interpret it. He
classed Daniel and his three companions, Shadrach,
Meshach and Abednego, with these men,
though there really was nothing in them in common
with the two classes of men. Being informed
that it was impossible to discover a dream like
that, and at their saying if the king would tell the
dream to them, they would interpret it, the king
became very angry, and ordered them to be put
to death. This sentence of death was against
Daniel and his three companions.</p>

<p>But Daniel appeared upon the stage of action.
At his suggestion the execution of the rash edict
was held up, and he immediately called his three
companions into counsel, and he urged them to
unite with him in a concert of prayer that God
would discover to Daniel the dream with the interpretation
thereof. In answer to this united
praying, it is recorded: “Then was the secret revealed
unto Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
blessed the God of heaven.” As a sequel to this
incident of the praying of these four men, Daniel
revealed to the king his dream and its interpretation,
and as a final result the king acknowledged
the God of Daniel and elevated to high positions
Daniel and his three associates. And it all came
about because there was a praying man there just
at a critical time. Blessed is that nation which
has praying men who can come to the help of
civil rulers who are greatly perplexed and in great
difficulties, and who can be depended upon to
pray for rulers of state and Church.</p>

<p>Years afterward, while still in a foreign land,
he still had not forgotten the God of his fathers,
and to him was given the noted vision of the “Ram
and the He Goat.” But Daniel did not comprehend
this strange vision, and yet he knew it was
from God and had a deep and future meaning for
nations and people. So, of course, he followed
the bent of his religious mind and prayed about it.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“And it came to pass when I even I Daniel, had
seen the vision, and sought for the meaning, then
behold there stood before me as the appearance
of a man.</p>

<p>“And I heard a man’s voice which called, and
said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the
vision.”</p>
</div>

<p>And so Gabriel made him understand the full
meaning of this remarkable vision. But it came
in answer to Daniel’s praying. So puzzling questions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
may often find an answer in the closet. And
as elsewhere, God employs angelic intelligences
to convey information as to prayer answers.
Angels have much to do with prayer. Praying
men and the angels of heaven are in close touch
with each other.</p>

<p>Some years thereafter, Daniel was studying the
records of the nation, and he discovered that it
was about time for the seventy years of captivity
of his people to end. So he gave himself to prayer:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“And I set my face to seek by prayer and supplications,
with fasting and sackcloth and ashes.
And I prayed unto the Lord, and made confession.”</p>
</div>

<p>Then follows the record in those Old Testament
Scriptures of Daniel’s prayer, so full of
meaning, so simple in its utterances, so earnest
in its spirit, so direct in its confession and requests,
worthy of being patterned after.</p>

<p>And it was while he was speaking in prayer
that the same archangel Gabriel, who seemed to
have a direct interest in the praying of this man
of God, “being caused to fly swiftly, touched me
about the time of the evening sacrifice, and he
informed me and talked with me,” and then gave
him much desired information valuable to Daniel.</p>

<p>The angels of God are much nearer us in our
seasons of prayer than we imagine. God employs
these glorious heavenly intelligences in the blessed
work of hearing and answering prayer, when the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
prayer, as in the case of Daniel on this occasion,
has to do with the present and future welfare
of His people.</p>

<p>One other incident on the prayer line in the
life of this captive man in Babylon. Another
revelation was made to Daniel, but the time of its
fulfillment appeared to be far in the future. “In
those days, I Daniel was mourning three full
weeks. I ate no pleasant bread, neither came
flesh nor wine into my mouth till the three whole
weeks were fulfilled.”</p>

<p>It was then that he had a very strange experience
and a still stranger revelation was made to
him by some angelic being. It is worth while
to read the scripture account:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“And behold a hand touched me, which set me
on my knees, and upon the palms of my hands.</p>

<p>“And he said unto me, O Daniel, a man greatly
beloved, understand the words that I speak unto
thee, and stand upright, for unto thee am I now
sent. And when he had spoken this word unto
me, I stood trembling.</p>

<p>“Then he said unto me, Fear not, Daniel; for
from the first day that thou didst set thy heart
to understand and to chasten thyself before thy
God, thy words were heard, and I am come for
thy words.</p>

<p>“But the Prince of the Kingdom of Persia
withstood me one and twenty days; but lo,
Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help
me, and I remained there with the kings of Persia.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>What all this means is difficult to comprehend,
but enough appears on its face to lead us to believe
that the angels in heaven are deeply interested in
our praying, and are sent to tell us the answers
to our prayers. Further, it is very clear that some
unseen forces or invisible spirits are operating
to hinder the answers to our prayers. Who the
Prince of Persia was who withstood this great
angelic being is not divulged, but enough is revealed
to know that there must be a contest in
the unseen world about us between those spirits
sent to minister to us in answer to our prayers
and the devil and his evil spirits who seek to defeat
these good spirits.</p>

<p>The passage furthermore gives us some intimation
as to the cause of delayed answers to prayer.
For “three full weeks” Daniel mourned and
prayed, and for “one and twenty days” the divinely
appointed angel was opposed by the “Prince of
the Kingdom of Persia.”</p>

<p>Well was it for praying Daniel that he had
the courage, fortitude and determination to persist
in his praying for three weeks while the fearful
conflict between good and bad spirits was going
on about him unseen by mortal eyes. Well will
it be for us if we do not give up in our praying
when God seems not to hear and the answer is
not immediate. It takes time to pray, and it
takes time to get the answer to prayer. Delays
in answering prayer are not denials. Failure to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
receive an immediate answer is no evidence that
God does not hear prayer. It takes not only
courage and persistence to pray successfully, but
it requires much patience. “Wait on the Lord and
be of good courage; and he shall strengthen thy
heart; wait, I say, on the Lord.”</p>

<small>FAITH OF SINNERS IN PRAYER</small></h2>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>A certain preacher whose sermons converted many souls
received a revelation from God that it was not his sermons
or works by all means but the prayers of an illiterate
lay brother who sat on the pulpit steps pleading for
the success of the sermon. It may be in the all-revealing
day so with us. We may believe after laboring long and
wearily that all honor belongs to another builder whose
prayers were gold, silver, and precious stones, while
our sermonizings being apart from prayer are but hay and
stubble.</i>—<span class="smcap">Rev. C. H. Spurgeon.</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> of the peculiar features of prayer as we
study the Old Testament on this subject is the
faith of unrighteous and back-slidden men in prayer,
and the great confidence they had in the prayers
of praying men of that day. They knew certain
men as men of prayer, who believed in God, who
were favored of God and who prayed unto God.
They recognized these men as having influence
with God in averting wrath and in giving deliverance
from evil.</p>

<p>Frequently when in trouble, when God’s wrath
was threatened and even when there were visitations
of evil upon them for their iniquities, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
showed their faith in prayer by appealing to the
men who prayed, to beg God to avert His displeasure
and turn aside His wrath against them.
Recognizing the value of prayer as a divine
agency to save men, they made application to
the men who prayed, to intercede with God for
them.</p>

<p>It is one of the strange paradoxes of those
early days that while people departed from God,
and went into grievous sin, they did not become
either atheists nor unbelievers when it came to
the question of the existence of a prayer-answering
God. Wicked men held fast to a belief in God’s
existence, and to faith in the power of prayer to
secure pardon for sin and to deliver them from
God’s wrath. It is worth something as showing
the influence of the Church on sinners, when the
latter believe in prayer and beg Christian people
to pray for them. It is an item of interest and
an event of importance when a sinner on a dying
bed calls for a praying man to come to his bedside
to pray for him. It means something when penitent
sinners, under a sense of their guilt, feeling
the displeasure of God, approach a church altar
and say, “Pray for me, ye praying men and
women.” Little does the Church understand its
full import, and still less does the Church appreciate
and take in the full import of praying, especially
for the unsaved men and women who ask
them to pray for their immortal souls. If the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
Church was fully alive to God and awake to the
real peril of the unconverted all about it, and
was in a thriving state, more sinners would be
found seeking the altars of the Church and crying
out to praying people, “Pray for my soul.”</p>

<p>Much so-called praying for sinners there may
be, but it is cold, formal, official praying, which
goes nowhere, never reaches God, and accomplishes
nothing. Revivals begin when sinners seek
the prayers of praying people.</p>

<p>Several things stand out in bold relief as we
look at those Old Testament days:</p>

<p>First, the disposition of sinners against God
to almost involuntarily turn to praying men for
help and refuge when trouble draws near, and
to invoke their prayers for relief and deliverance.
“Pray for us” was their cry.</p>

<p>Second, the readiness with which those praying
men responded to these appeals and prayed to
God for those who desired this thing. Moreover,
we are impressed with the fact that these praying
men were always in the spirit of prayer and ready
at any time to inquire of God. They were always
keyed up on prayer.</p>

<p>Third, we note the wonderful influence these
men of prayer had with God whenever they made
their appeal to Him. God nearly always quickly
responded and heard their praying for others.
So intercessory prayer predominated in those early
days of the Church.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>It is a question worthy of earnest consideration,
how far the present-day Church is responsible
for the unbelief of sinners of these modern times
in the value of prayer as an agency in averting
God’s wrath, in sparing barren lives and in giving
deliverance. How far is the Church responsible
for the precious few mourners in Zion in these
times, who ignore your altar calls and treat with
indifference your appeals to come and be prayed
for?</p>

<p>The first illustration we notice as showing the
faith of wicked men in prayer and their appeal
for a man of God to intercede for them is the
case of the fiery serpents sent upon the Israelites.
They were journeying from Mount Hor by way
of the Red Sea, seeking to compass the land of
Edom, when they spoke against God and Moses,
after this fashion:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Wherefore have ye brought us up out of
Egypt to die in the wilderness? for there is no
bread, neither is there any water; and our soul
loatheth this light bread.”</p>
</div>

<p>The thing so sorely displeased God that He
sent fiery serpents among the people, and many
of the people of Israel died.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Therefore the people came to Moses, and
said, We have sinned because we have spoken
against the Lord, and against thee; pray unto the
Lord, that He take away the serpents from us.”</p>
</div>

<p>And Moses prayed for the people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>As far as these people had departed from God,
and as great as was their sin in complaining
against God’s dealings with them, they had not
lost faith in prayer, neither did they forget that
there was a leader in Israel who had influence
with God in prayer, and who could by that means
avert disaster and bring deliverance to them.</p>

<p>Jeroboam, first King of the ten tribes when
the kingdom was divided, was another case in
point. This was a most noted case because of
the notoriety of his departure from God, which
was often referred to in the after history of
Israel, as “the sin of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat,”
and shows that despite his great wickedness in
the sight of God, he did not lose his faith in the
efficacy of prayer. This king on one occasion
presumed to take the place of the high priest, and
stood by the altar to burn incense. A man of God
came out of Judah and cried against the altar and
proclaimed, “Behold the altar shall be rent, and
the ashes that are upon it shall be poured out.”
This angered Jeroboam, who saw that it was intended
as a public rebuke for him, who had undertaken
contrary to the Levitical law to assume the
office of God’s priest, and the king put forth his
hand with the apparent purpose of arresting or
doing violence to the man of God, saying, at the
same time to those about him, “Lay hold upon
him.”</p>

<p>Immediately God smote the king with leprosy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
so that he could not pull his hand back again, and
at the same time the altar was rent. Astonished
beyond measure at this sudden retribution for
his sin, coming like lightning from heaven, and
very much afraid, he cried out to the man of God,
“Entreat now the face of the Lord thy God for
me, that my hand may be restored again.” And
it is recorded that “the man of God besought the
Lord, and the king’s hand was restored him again,
and became as it was before.”</p>

<p>Let us keep in mind that we are not now considering
the praying habits of the man of God
nor the possibilities of prayer, though both face
us here. But rather we are finding just here
that a ruler in Israel, guilty of a grievous sin,
and departing from God, when God’s wrath falls
upon him, he immediately calls upon a praying
man to intercede with God in his behalf. It is
but another case where a sinner against God
showed his faith in the virtue of the prayers of
a man of God. Sad is the day in a Christian
land, not only where there is the decay of prayer
in the Church, but where sinners are so unaffected
by the religion of the Church that they have no
faith in prayer and care little about the prayers
of praying men.</p>

<p>Another illustration follows this case very
quickly. The son of King Jeroboam fell sick, and
was about to die. And this wicked, indifferent
king, posted his wife off to Ahijah, the prophet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
of God, to ask him to say what would be the result
of the illness of the child. She attempted to practice
a deception upon the old prophet who was
nearly blind, intending not to make herself known
to him. But he had the vision of a prophet even
though dim in sight, and immediately revealed to
her that she was known to him. After telling
her many things of vast importance concerning
the kingdom and charging her husband that he
had not kept God’s commandments, but had gone
into idolatry, he said to her: “Arise, therefore,
and get thee down to thy house; and when thy
feet enter into the city, the child shall die.”</p>

<p>How natural for a father in trouble to appeal
to a praying prophet for relief? And as in the
first mentioned case, his sin did not blind his eyes
to the value of having a man of God intercede
for him. It availed nothing as was proved, but
it did prove our contention that in Old Testament
times sinners, while they were not themselves
praying men, believed strongly in the prayers of
praying men.</p>

<p>Take the instance of Johanan, just as the Children
of Israel began their life of captivity in
Babylon. Johanan and Jeremiah, with a small
company, had been left in their native land, and
Ishmael had conspired against Gedaliah, the appointed
governor of the country, and had slain
him. Johanan came to the rescue and delivered
the people from Ishmael who was taking them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
away from their land. But Johanan wanted to
flee down into Egypt, which was contrary to the
Divine plan. At this particular juncture of affairs,
he assembled all the people, and they went to
Jeremiah with the earnest appeal:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We beseech thee, let our supplication be accepted
before thee, and pray for us unto the Lord
thy God, that the Lord thy God may show us
the way wherein we may walk, and the thing that
we may do.”</p>
</div>

<p>Like all other appeals to good men for prayer,
Jeremiah interceded for these inquirers after the
right way, and after ten days the answer came,
and they were informed by Jeremiah what God
would have them do. This was to the effect that
they should not go down to Egypt, but remain
in and about Jerusalem, but the people and
Johanan played Jeremiah false, and refused to do
as God had told them in answer to prayer. But
it did not disprove the fact that they had faith
in prayer and in praying men.</p>

<p>Another case may be noticed as showing the
truth of our proposition that sinners had faith in
prayer in the Old Testament dispensation, thus
indirectly proving the preëminence of prayer in
those days, for certainly prayer must have had a
prominent place and its necessity must have received
general recognition, when even sinners by
their actions give endorsement to its virtue and
necessity. Surely if sinners bore testimony to its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
worth, and at that time displayed their need of
prayer, even by the prayers of some one else,
Church people of this day ought to have a deep
sense of its need, and should have strong faith in
prayer and its virtue. And certainly if the men
of Old Testament times were such men of prayer,
and had such a reputation as praying men, then in
this favored day, Christian men should be so given
to prayer that they also would have a wide reputation
as praying men.</p>

<p>Zedekiah was king of Judah just as the captivity
of God’s people began. He was in charge of the
kingdom when Jerusalem was besieged by the
King of Babylon. And it was just about this time
that Zedekiah sent two chosen men unto Jeremiah
saying: “Inquire, I pray thee, of the Lord for
us; for Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, maketh
war against us; if so be that the Lord will deal
with us according to all his wondrous works, that
he may go up from us.”</p>

<p>And God told Jeremiah in answer to this inquiry
what to do, and what would occur, but as
in another case, that of Johanan, Zedekiah proved
false, and would not do as God instructed Jeremiah
to tell him. At the same time it proved
conclusively that Zedekiah had not lost his faith
in prayer as a means of finding out the mind of
God, nor did it affect him in his belief in the
virtue of the prayers of a praying man.</p>

<p>Verily, prayer must have had a preëminent place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
in all Old Testament history when not only the
men of God were noted for their praying habits,
but even men who departed from God and proved
false bore testimony to its virtue by appealing to
the men of prayer to make intercessions for them.
This is so notorious in Old Testament history that
no careful reader of these old scriptures can fail
to discover and notice it.</p>

<small>PAUL, THE TEACHER OF PRAYER</small></h2>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Fletcher of Madeley, a great teacher of a century and
a half ago, used to lecture to the young theological students.
He was one of the fellow-workers with Wesley
and a man of most saintly character. When he had
lectured on one of the great topics of the Word of God,
such as the Fullness of God’s Holy Spirit or on the power
and blessing that He meant His people to have, he would
close the lecture and say, “That is the theory; now will
those who want the practice come along up to my room?”
And again and again they closed their books and went
away to his room, where the hour’s theory would be
followed by one or two hours of prayer.</i>—<span class="smcap">Rev. Hubert Brooke.</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">How</span> instant, strenuous, persistent, and pathetic
was Paul’s urgency of prayer upon those to whom
he wrote and spoke! “I exhort,” says he, writing
to Timothy, “first of all, that supplications,
prayers, intercessions and giving of thanks be
made for all men.” This he meant was to be the
prime deposit and truth for the Church. First of
all, before all things, to the front of all things, the
Church of Christ was to be a praying Church,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
was to pray for men, was to pray for all men.
He charged the Philippians to this effect: “Be
careful for nothing, but in everything, by prayer
and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests
be made known unto God.” The Church
must be anxious about nothing. In everything
prayer must be made. Nothing was too small
about which to pray. Nothing was too great for
God to overcome.</p>

<p>Paul lays it down as a vital, all-essential injunction
in writing to the Church at Thessalonica,
“Rejoice evermore. Pray without ceasing. In
everything give thanks. For this is the will of
God concerning you.” The Church must give
itself to unceasing prayer. Never was prayer to
cease in the Church. This was the will of God
concerning His Church on earth.</p>

<p>Paul was not only given to prayer himself, but
he continually and earnestly urged it in a way
that showed its vital importance. He was not
only insistent in urging prayer upon the Church
in his day, but he urged persistent praying. “Continue
in prayer and watch in the same,” was the
keynote of all his exhortations on prayer. “Praying
always with all prayer and supplication,” was
the way he pressed this important matter upon
the people. “I will, therefore,” I exhort, this is
my desire, my mind upon this question, “that men
pray everywhere, without wrath and doubting.”
As he prayed after this fashion himself, he could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
afford to press it upon those to whom he ministered.</p>

<p>Paul was a leader by appointment and by universal
recognition and acceptance. He had many
mighty forces in this ministry. His conversion,
so conspicuous and radical, was a great force, a
perfect magazine of aggressive and defensive warfare.
His call to the apostleship was clear, luminous
and convincing. But these forces were not
the divinest energies which brought forth the
largest results to his ministry. Paul’s course was
more distinctly shaped and his career rendered
more powerfully successful by prayer than by
any other force.</p>

<p>It is no surprise then that he should give such
prominence to prayer in his preaching and writing.
We could not expect it to be otherwise. As prayer
was the highest exercise in his personal life, so
also prayer assumed the same high place in his
teaching. His example of prayer added force
to his teaching on prayer. His practice and his
teaching ran in parallel lines. There was no inconsistency
in the two things.</p>

<p>Paul was the chiefest of the apostles as he was
chief in prayer. If he was the first of the apostles,
prayer conspired to that end. Hence he was all
the better qualified to be a teacher on prayer.
His praying fitted him to teach others what prayer
was and what prayer could do. And for this reason
he was competent to urge upon the people that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
they must not neglect prayer. Too much depended
upon it.</p>

<p>He was first in prayer for this cause. For the
reason that on him centered more saintly praying
than on any one else, he became the first in apostleship.
The crown of martyrdom was the highest
crown in the royalty of heaven, but prayer put
this crown of martyrdom on his head.</p>

<p>He who would teach the people to pray must
first himself be given to prayer. He who urges
prayer on others must first tread the path of
prayer himself. And just in proportion as preachers
pray, will they be disposed to urge prayer upon
those to whom they preach. Moreover, just in
proportion as preachers pray, will they be fitted
to preach on prayer. If that course of reasoning
be true, would it be legitimate to draw the conclusion
that the reason why there is so little
preaching on prayer in these modern times is because
preachers are not praying men?</p>

<p>We might stake the whole question of the absolute
necessity and the possibilities of prayer in
this dispensation on Paul’s attitude toward prayer.
If personal force, if the energy of a strong will,
if profound convictions, if personal culture and
talents, and if the Divine call and the Divine
empowerment,—if any one of these, or all of
them united, could direct the Church of God without
prayer, then logically prayer would be unnecessary.
If profound piety and unswerving consecration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
to a high purpose, if impassioned loyalty to
Jesus Christ, if any or all of these could exist
without devoted prayer, or lift a Church leader
above the necessity of prayer, then Paul was above
its use. But if the great and gifted, the favored
and devoted Paul felt the necessity of unceasing
prayer, and realized that it was urgent and pressing
in regard to its claims and necessity, and if
he felt that it was clamorous and insistent that
the Church should pray without ceasing, then he
and his brethren in the apostolate should be aided
by universal and mighty praying.</p>

<p>Paul’s praying and his commands and the
urgency with which he pressed upon the Church
to pray, is the most convincing proof of the absolute
necessity of prayer as a great moral force in
the world, an indispensable and inalienable factor
in the progress and spread of the Gospel, and in
the development of personal piety. In Paul’s
view, there was no Church success without prayer,
and no piety without prayer, in fact without much
prayer. A Church out of whose life streams
prayer as the incense flames went out of the censer,
and a leadership out of whose character, life and
habits flames prayer as imposing, conspicuous and
spontaneous as the fragrant incense flamed, this
was the leadership for God.</p>

<p>To pray everywhere, to pray in everything, to
continue instant in prayer, and to pray without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
ceasing, thus Paul spoke as a commentator on
the Divine uses and the nature of prayer.</p>

<p>Timothy was very dear to Paul, and the attachment
was mutual and intensified by all their
affinities. Paul found in Timothy those elements
which fitted him to be his spiritual successor, at
least the depository and the leader of the great
spiritual principles and forces which were essential
to the establishment and prosperity of the
Church. These primary and vital truths he would
enforce on and radicate in Timothy. Paul regarded
Timothy as one to whom fundamental and
vital truths might be committed, who would preserve
them truly, and who would commit them
inviolate to the future. So he gives to Timothy
this deposit of prayer for all ages as found in
1st Timothy 2:1.</p>

<p>Let it be noted before we go any further that
Paul wrote directly under the superintendency of
the Holy Spirit, who guarded Paul against error,
and who suggested the truths which Paul taught.
We hold definitely without compromise in the least
to the plenary inspiration of the Scriptures, and
as Paul’s writings are part and parcel of those
Sacred Writings, then Paul’s Epistles are portions
of the Scriptures or the Word of God. This
being true, the doctrine of prayer which Paul
affirmed is the doctrine of the Holy Spirit. His
Epistles are of the Word of God, inspired, authentic
and of Divine authority. So that prayer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
as taught by Paul is the doctrine which Almighty
God would have His Church accept, believe, and
practice.</p>

<p>These words to Timothy, therefore, were divinely
inspired words. This section of Holy Writ
is much more than merely suggestive, and is far
more than a broad, bare outline on prayer. It
is so instructive about prayer, about how men
ought to pray, how business men should pray, and
so forceful about the reasons why men ought to
pray, that it needs to be strongly and insistently
pressed.</p>

<p>Here are Paul’s words to Timothy on prayer:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I exhort, therefore, that, first of all, supplications,
prayers, intercessions and giving of thanks,
be made for all men;</p>

<p>“For kings and all that are in authority that
we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all
godliness and honesty.</p>

<p>“For this is good and acceptable in the sight
of God, our Saviour;</p>

<p>“Who will have all men to be saved and to
come to the knowledge of the truth.</p>

<p>“For there is one God, and one Mediator between
God and men, the man Christ Jesus;</p>

<p>“Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be
testified in due time. I will therefore that men
pray everywhere, lifting up holy hands, without
wrath and doubting.”</p>
</div>

<p>In this prayer section we have set forth by
Paul the inheritance and practice of every Christian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
in all ages. It is a <i>vade mecum</i> in the great
business of praying. It gives us a view of the
energy and many-sidedness of prayer. First in
point of time in all excellence of all duties is
prayer. It must be first in all occupations. So exacting
and imperative in its import and power is
prayer that it stands first among spiritual values.
He that prays not, is not at all. He is naught, less
than naught. He is below zero, so far as Christ
and God and heaven are concerned. Not simply
among the first things does prayer stand on a
level with other things, but first of the first, to
the very forefront, does Paul put prayer with all
his heart. “I exhort that first of all.”</p>

<p>His teaching is that praying is the most important
of all things on earth. All else must be
restrained, retired, to give it primacy. Put it
first, and keep its primacy. The conflict is about
the primacy of prayer. Defeat and victory lie in
this one thing. To make prayer secondary is to
discrown it. It is to fetter and destroy prayer.
If prayer is put first, then God is put first, and
victory is assured. Prayer must either reign in
the life or must abdicate. Which shall it be?</p>

<p>According to Paul, “supplications, prayers, intercessions
and giving of thanks” all these elements
of prayer and forms of prayer are to be
offered for men. Prayer is offered for things,
for all things, for all temporal good, and for all
spiritual good and grace, but in these directions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
Paul rises to the highest results and purposes of
prayer. Men are to be affected by prayer. Their
good, their character, conduct and destiny are
all involved in prayer. In this regard prayer
moves along the highest way, and pursues its
loftiest end. We are cognizant and consonant
with things, with blessings, and bestowments, with
matters and things which touch men, but men
themselves are here set forth as the objects of
prayer. This broadens and ennobles prayer.
Men, through the whole sweep and range of their
conditions, are to be held in the mighty grasp of
prayer.</p>

<p>Paul’s teaching is to the effect that prayer is
essentially a thing of the inner nature. The spirit
within us prays. So note Paul’s directions: “I
will therefore that men pray everywhere, without
wrath.” “Wrath” is a term which denotes the
natural, internal motion of plants and fruits, swelling
with juice. The natural juices are warmed
into life, and rise by the warmth of Spring. Man
has in him natural juices which rise as does the
sap. Warmth, heat, all stages of passions and
desires, every degree of feeling, these spontaneously
rise under provocation. Guard against and
suppress them. Man cannot pray with these natural
feelings rising in him, cultivated, cherished
and continued there. Prayer is to be without
these. “Without wrath.” Higher, better, nobler<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
inspiration are to lift prayer upward. “Wrath”
depresses prayer, hinders it, suppresses it.</p>

<p>The word “without” means making no use of,
having no association with, apart from, aloof
from. The natural, unrenewed heart has no part
in praying. Its heat and all its nature juices
poison and destroy praying. The nature of prayer
is deeper than nature. We cannot pray by nature,
even by the kindliest and the best nature.</p>

<p>Prayer is the true test of character. Fidelity
to our conditions and trueness to our relations
are often evinced by our prayerfulness. Some
conditions give birth to prayer. They are the
soil which germinates and perfects prayer. To
pray under some circumstances seems very fitting.
Not to pray in some conditions seems heartless
and discordant. The great storms of life, when
we are helpless and without relief, or are devoid
of assuagement, are the natural and providential
conditions of prayer.</p>

<p>Widowhood is a great sorrow. It comes to
saintly women as well as to others. True widows
there are who are saintly. They are to be honored
and their sorrow is divine. Their piety is
aromatic and lightened by their bruised hearts.
Here is Paul’s description of such widows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Now she that is a widow indeed and desolate,
trusteth in God, and continueth in supplications
and prayers night and day. But she that liveth in
pleasure is dead while she liveth.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>Here is the striking contrast between two classes
of women. One gives herself to supplications
night and day. The other lives in pleasure and
is spiritually dead. So Paul describes a true
widow as being great in prayer. Her prayers,
born of her faith and desolation, are a mighty
force. Day and night her prayers go up to God
unceasingly. The widowhood heart is a mighty
appeal to God when that heart is found in the
way of prayer, intense, unwearied prayer.</p>

<p>One of Paul’s striking injunctions worthy of
study is this one, “continuing instant in prayer,” or
as the Revised Version reads, “Continuing steadfast
in prayer,” which is his description of prayer.
The term means to tarry, to remain, to be steadfast
and faithful in prayer, to stick to it strong,
to stay at it with strength to the end, to give
attention to it with vigor, devotion and constancy,
to give unremitting care to it.</p>

<p>Praying is a business, a life-long business,
one to be followed with diligence, fervor and toil.
The Christian’s business by way of preëminence
is prayer. It is his most engaging, most heavenly,
most lucrative business. Prayer is a business of
such high and deserved dignity and import that
it is to be followed “without ceasing.” That is,
with no let up nor break down, followed assiduously
and without intermission. To prayer we
are to give all strength. It must cover all things,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
be in every place, find itself in all seasons, and
embrace everything, always, and everywhere.</p>

<p>In the remarkable prayer in Ephesians, 3d chapter,
he is praying for wide reaches of religious experience.
He is there bowing his knees unto God,
in the name of Jesus Christ, and asking that God
would grant that these Ephesian believers would
in their experiences go far beyond the utmost
stretches of past sainthood. “Filled with all the
fullness of God,” an experience so great and so
glorious that it makes the head of the modern
saint so dizzy that he is afraid to look up to those
supernal heights or peer down into the fathomless
depths. Paul just passes us on to Him, “who is
able to do exceeding abundantly above all that
we can ask or think.” This is a specimen of his
teaching on prayer.</p>

<p>In writing to the Philippian Church, Paul recounts
the situation, and shows the transmuting
power of prayer as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Some indeed preach Christ of envy and strife;
and some also of good will;</p>

<p>“The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely,
supposing to add affliction to my bonds;</p>

<p>“But the other of love, knowing that I am set
for the defense of the Gospel.</p>

<p>“What then? Notwithstanding every way,
whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is
preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will
rejoice.</p>

<p>“For I know that this shall turn to my salvation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
through our prayer and the supply of the
Spirit of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>“According to my earnest expectation and my
hope; that in nothing shall I be ashamed, but that
with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ
shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by
life or death.”</p>
</div>

<p>Boldness was to be secured by him and discomfiture
and shame prevented by their prayers,
and Christ was to be gloriously magnified by and
through Paul, whether he lived or died.</p>

<p>It is to be remarked that in all these quotations
in Corinthians, Ephesians or Philippians, the Revised
Version gives us the most intense form of
prayer, “supplications.” It is the intense, personal,
strenuous, persistent praying of the saints,
that Paul requests, and they must give special
strength, interest, time and heart to their praying
to make it bear its largest golden fruit.</p>

<p>The general direction about prayer to the Colossian
Christians is made specific and is sharpened
to the point of a personal appeal: “Continue
in prayer and watch in the same, with thanksgiving;
withal praying also for us, that God would
open unto us a door of utterance, to speak the
mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds;
that I make it manifest as I ought to speak.”</p>

<p>Paul is accredited with the authorship of the
Epistle to the Hebrews. We have it in a reference
to the character of Christ’s praying, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
is illustrative, directory and authentative as to the
elements of true praying. How deep tones are
his words! How heart-affecting and how sublime
was His praying who prayed as never man
prayed before, and yet prayed in order to teach
man how to pray, “who in the days of His flesh,
when He had offered prayers and supplications,
with strong crying and tears, to Him that was
able to save Him from death, and was heard
in that He feared.” The praying of Jesus Christ
drew on the mightiest forces of His being. His
prayers were His sacrifices, which He offered
before He offered Himself on the cross for the
sins of mankind. Prayer-sacrifice is the forerunner
and pledge of self-sacrifice. We must die
in our closets before we can die on the cross.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>In the life of Frank Crossley it is told how one day
in 1888 he had said good-bye at the station to his friends,
General and Mrs. Booth; but before they steamed out he
handed a letter to them giving details of a sacrifice he
had resolved to make for the Army. He came home
and was praying alone. “As I was praying,” he said,
“there came over me the most extraordinary sense of joy.
It was not exactly in my head, nor in my heart, it was
almost a grasping of my chest by some strange hand that
filled me with an ecstasy I never had before. It was
borne in on me that this was the joy of the Lord.” So
this servant of God made in his pilgrimage to God an
advance from which he never fell back. He thought it
likely at the time that the Booths had read this letter
in the train and this was an answer to prayer of theirs;
afterwards he heard they had prayed for him in the train
just after getting well out of Manchester.</i>—<span class="smcap">Rev. Edward Shillito.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">He</span> who studies Paul’s praying, both his prayers
and his commands about prayer, will find what
a wide, general, minute, and diversified area it

Brainerd, Luther, and all their holy successors
in the spiritual realms, were not guilty of fanaticism
nor superstition when they ordered all things<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
by prayer great and small, and committed all
things, secular and religious, natural and spiritual,
to God in prayer. In this they were but following
the great exemplar and authority of the Apostle
Paul.</p>

<p>To seek God as Paul did by prayer, to commune
with God as Paul did, to supplicate Jesus
Christ as Paul did, to seek the Holy Spirit by
prayer as Paul did, to do this without ceasing,
to be always a racer, and to win Christ as Paul
did by prayer—all this makes a saint, an apostle,
and a leader for God. This kind of a life engages,
absorbs, enriches, and empowers with God
and for God. Prayer, if successful, must always
engage and absorb us. This kind of praying
brings Pauline days and secures Pauline gifts.
Pauline days are good, Pauline gifts are better,
but Pauline praying is best of all, for it brings
Pauline days, and secures Pauline gifts. Pauline
praying costs much, is death to self, the flesh and
the world. Pauline praying is worth all it costs.
Prayer which costs nothing gets nothing. It is
beggarly business at best.</p>

<p>Paul’s estimate of prayer is seen and enforced
by the fact that Paul was a man of prayer. His
high position in the Church was not one of dignity
and position to enjoy and luxuriate in. It was
not one of officialism, nor was it one of arduous
and exhaustless toil, for Paul was preëminently
a praying man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>He began his great career for Christ in the
great struggle and school of prayer. God’s convincing
and wonderful argument to assure Ananias
was, “Behold he prayeth.” Three days
was he without sight, neither eating nor drinking,
but the lesson was learned well.</p>

<p>He went out on his first great missionary trip
under the power of fasting and prayer, and they,
Paul and Barnabas, established every Church by
the very same means, by fasting and prayer. He
began his work in Philippi “where prayer was
wont to be made.” As “they went to prayer,”
the spirit of divination was cast out of the young
woman. And when Paul and Silas were put in
prison, at midnight they prayed and sang praises
to God.</p>

<p>Paul made praying a habit, a business and a
life. He literally gave himself to prayer. So
with him praying was not an outer garb, a mere
coloring, a paint, a polish. Praying made up the
substance, the bone, the marrow, and the very
being of his religious life. His conversion was
a marvel of grace and power. His apostolic
commission was full and royal. But he did not
vainly expect to make full proof of his ministry,
by the marvels of conditions and by wonderful
results in the conversion, nor by the apostolic commission
signed and sealed by Divine authority, and
carrying with it all highest gifts and apostolic enrichments,
but by prayer, by ceaseless, wrestling,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
agonizing and Holy Spirit praying. Thus did
Paul work his work, and crown his work, his life
and the death with martyr principles and with
martyr glory.</p>

<p>Paul had a spiritual trait which was very
marked and especially promised, and it was that of
prayer. He had a profound conviction that prayer
was a great as well as a solemn duty; that prayer
was a royal privilege; that prayer was a mighty
force; that prayer gauges piety, makes faith
mighty and mightier; that much prayer was
necessary to Christian success; that prayer was
a great factor in the ongoing of God’s kingdom
on earth; and that God and heaven expected to
pray.</p>

<p>Somehow we are dependent on prayer for
great triumphs of holiness over sin, of heaven
over hell, and of Christ over Satan. Paul took
it for granted that men who knew God would
pray; that men who lived for God would pray
much, and that men could not live for God who
did not pray. So Paul prayed much. He was
in the habit of praying. He was used to praying,
and that formed the habit of prayer. He
estimated prayer so greatly that he fully knew
its value, and that fastened the habit on him.
Paul was in the habit of praying because he loved
God, and such love in the heart always finds its
expression in regular habits of prayer. He felt
the need of much grace, and of more and more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
grace, and grace only comes through the channels
of prayer, and only abounds more and more as
prayer abounds more and more.</p>

<p>Paul was in the habit of praying, but he prayed
not by mere force of habit. Man is such a creature
of habit that he is always in danger of doing
things simply by heart, in a routine, perfunctory
manner. Paul’s habit was regular and hearty.
To the Romans he writes, “For God is my witness,
that without ceasing, I make mention of you
always in my prayers.” Prison doors are opened
and earthquakes take place by such praying as
Paul did, even by such melodious Pauline praying.
All things are opened to the kind of praying
which was done by Paul and Silas. All things
are opened by prayer. They could shut up Paul
from preaching, but this could not shut him up
from praying. And the Gospel could win its way
by Paul’s praying as well as by Paul’s preaching.
The apostle might be in prison, but the Word
of God was free, and went like the mountain air,
while the apostle is bound in prison and abounds
in prayer.</p>

<p>How profound their joy in Jesus which expressed
itself so happily and so sweetly in praise
and prayer, under conditions so painful and so
depressing! Prayer brought them into full communion
with God which made all things radiant
with the Divine presence which enabled them to
“rejoice that they were counted worthy to suffer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
shame for His name, and to count it all joy when
they fell into divers trials.” Prayer sweetens all
things and sanctifies all things. The prayerful
saint will be a suffering saint. Suffering prayerfully
he will be a sweet saint. A praying saint
will be a praising saint. Praise is but prayer set
to music and song.</p>

<p>After that notable charge to the elders at
Ephesus, as he tarried there while on his way
to Jerusalem, this characteristic record is made
in Acts:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled
down and prayed with them. And they all wept
sore, and fell on Paul’s neck and kissed him.”</p>
</div>

<p>“He kneeled down and prayed.” Note those
words. Kneeling in prayer was Paul’s favorite
attitude, the fitting posture of an earnest,
humble suppliant. Humility and intensity are
in such a position in prayer before Almighty God.
It is the proper attitude of man before God, of
a sinner before a Saviour, and of a beggar before
his benefactor. To seal his sacred and living
charge to those Ephesian elders by prayer was
that which made the charge efficient, benignant
and abiding.</p>

<p>Paul’s religion was born in the throes of that
three days’ struggle of prayer, while he was in
the house of Ananias, and there he received a
divine impetus which never slackened till it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
brought him to the gates of the eternal city. That
spiritual history and religious experience projected
along the line of unceasing prayer, brought him to
the highest spiritual altitudes and yields the
largest spiritual results. Paul lived in the very
atmosphere of prayer. His first missionary trip
was projected by prayer. It was by prayer and
fasting that he was called into the foreign missionary
field, and by the same means the Church at
Antioch was moved to send forth Paul and Barnabas
on their first missionary journey. Here is
the Scripture record of it:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Now there were in the Church which was at
Antioch certain prophets and teachers, as Barnabas
and Simeon, that was called Niger; and Lucius
of Cyrene, and Manean, which had been
brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.</p>

<p>“And as they ministered to the Lord, and
fasted, the Holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas
and Saul for the work whereunto I have called
them.</p>

<p>“And when they had fasted and prayed, and
had laid their hands on them, they sent them
away.”</p>
</div>

<p>Here is a model for all missionary outgoings,
a presage of success. Here was the Holy Spirit
directing a prayerful Church obedient to the
Divine leadership, and this condition of things
brought forth the very largest possible results
in the mission of these two men of God. We may
confidently assert that no Church in which Paul<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
was prominent would be a prayerless Church.
Paul lived, toiled and suffered in an atmosphere of
prayer. To him, prayer was the very heart and
life of religion, its bone and marrow, the motor
of the Gospel, and the sign by which it conquered.
We are not left in ignorance, for that spirit established
churches, putting in them the everlasting
requisite of self-denial, in the shape of fasting,
and in the practice of prayer. Here is the Divine
record of Paul’s work on this line:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting
them to continue in the faith, and that
we must through much tribulation enter into the
kingdom of God.</p>

<p>“And when they had ordained them elders in
every Church, and had prayed with fasting, they
commended them to the Lord, on whom they believed.”</p>
</div>

<p>In obedience to a heavenly vision, Paul lands
in Europe, and finds himself at Philippi. There
is no synagogue, and few if any Jews are there.
A few pious women, however, have a meeting
place for prayer, and Paul is drawn by spiritual
attraction and spiritual affinities to the place
“where prayer is wont to be made.” And Paul’s
first planting of the Gospel in Europe is at that
little prayer meeting. He is there the chief
pray-er and the leading talker. Lydia was the
first convert at that prayer meeting. They protracted
the meeting. They called it a meeting for
prayer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>It was while they were going to that protracted
prayer meeting that Paul performed the miracle
of casting the devil of divination out of a poor
demon-possessed girl, who had been made a source
of gain by some covetous men, the results of
which, by the magistrate’s orders, were his scourging
and imprisonment. The result by God’s orders
was the conversion of the jailer and his
whole household. To the praying apostle no
discouragements are allowed. A few praying
women are enough for an apostolical field of labor.</p>

<p>In this last incident we have a picture of Paul
at midnight. He is in the inner prison, dark
and deadly. He has been severely and painfully
scourged, his clothing is covered with blood,
while there are blood clots on his gnashed and
torn body. His feet are in the stocks, every
nerve is feverish and swollen, sensitive and painful.
But we find him under these very unfavorable
and suffering conditions at his favorite pursuit.
Paul is praying with Silas, his companion,
in a joyous, triumphant strain. “And at midnight,
Paul and Silas prayed and sang praises
unto God, and the prisoners heard them. And
suddenly there was an earthquake, so that the
foundation of the prison was shaken, and immediately
all the doors were shaken; and every
one’s ban was loosed. And the keeper of the
prison awaking out of his sleep, and seeing the
prison doors opened, he drew out his sword, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
would have killed himself, supposing that the
prisoners had been fled.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“But Paul cried out with a loud voice saying,
Do thyself no harm; for we are all here.”</p>
</div>

<p>Never was prayer so beautiful, never more resultful.
Paul was an adept at prayer, a lover
of prayer, a wondrous devotee of prayer, who
could pursue it with such joyous strains, under
such conditions of despondency and despair. What
a mighty weapon of defense was prayer to Paul!
How songful! The angels doubtless stilled their
highest and sweetest notes to listen to the music
which bore those prayers to heaven. The earthquake
trod along the path made by the mighty
forces of Paul’s praying. He did not go out
when his chains were loosed, and the stocks fell
off. His praying taught him that God had nobler
purposes that night than his own individual freedom.
His praying and the earthquake alarm
were to bring salvation to that prison, freedom
from the thraldom and prison house of sin which
was prefigured to him by his body emancipation.
God’s mighty providence had opened his prison
door and had broken his prison bonds, not to
give freedom, but to give freedom to the jailer.
God’s providential openings are often to test
our ability to stay rather than to go. It tested
Paul’s ability to stay.</p>

<small>PAUL AND HIS PRAYING</small></h2>

<p class="center">(<i>Continued</i>)</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>William Law has this very pertinent word in his
“Devout Life”: “When you begin your petitions use such
various expressions of the attributes of God as may make
you most sensible of the greatness and power of the
Divine nature.” And then William Law gives various
examples, which I am bound to say would not be helpful
to me, as they would imprison my spirit in a coat of
mail. But I want to emphasize and commend the principle
of it, which is, that our fellowship should begin
with the primary elements of adoration and praise.</i>—<span class="smcap">Rev. J. H. Jowett.</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are two occasions with wonderful results
where the statement is not explicit that Paul
was in prayer, but the circumstances and the results,
and Paul’s universal and intense praying
habit, make it most evident that the key to the
results of both occasions is prayer. The first
occasion is when Paul sailed away from Philippi
and came to Troas, where he abode seven days.
On the first day of the week, when the disciples
came together to break bread, Paul preached unto<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
them, expecting to depart on the morrow, and continued
his preaching till late in the night.</p>

<p>There was sitting in the window a young man
named Eutychus, who naturally fell asleep, and
as Paul was rather long in speaking, the young
man fell out of the high window, and was taken
up for dead. Paul went down to the place where
the young man had fallen, and embracing him,
told the people about him that they need not be
troubled, for life was still in the body. Paul returned
to the upper room, where he had been
preaching, and talked with the disciples till break
of day. And the young man was brought alive,
and as a consequence all were greatly comforted.</p>

<p>The very natural conclusion without the fact
being specially stated is that Paul must have
prayed for the young man when he embraced him,
and his prayer was answered in the quick recovery
of the young man.</p>

<p>The second occasion was in the perilous and
protracted storm which overtook the vessel in
which Paul was being carried as a prisoner to
Rome. They were being exceedingly tossed about
with the great tempest, and neither sun nor stars
appeared as they were beset and struggled against
wind and storm. All hope that they would be
saved seemed gone. But after long abstinence,
Paul stood in the midst of those on board, and
speaking more particularly to the officers of the
vessel, said, “Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
me, and not have loosed from Crete, and to have
gained this harm and loss. And now I exhort
you, to be of good cheer, for there shall be no
loss of any man’s life among you, but of the ship.
For there stood by this night the angel of God,
whose I am and whom I serve, saying, Fear not,
Paul; thou must be brought before Cæsar, and
lo, God hath given thee all them that sail with
thee. Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer; for
I believe God, that it shall be even as God hath
told me.”</p>

<p>It requires no strained interpretation to read
into this simple record the fact that Paul must
have been praying when the angel appeared unto
him with that message of encouragement and assurance
of safety. Paul’s habit of prayer and his
strong belief in prayer must have driven him to
his knees. Such an emergency with him would
necessarily move him to pray under such crucial
circumstances.</p>

<p>After the shipwreck, while on the island of
Melita, we have another representation of Paul
at prayer. He is at his work of praying for a
very ill man. While a fire was being made, a
deadly poisonous viper fastened itself on his hand,
and the barbarians immediately concluded it was
a case of retribution for some crime Paul had
committed, but they soon discovered that Paul did
not die, and changed their minds and concluded
that he was a sort of god.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>In the same quarter at the time, was the father
of Publius, who was very ill of a fever, and bloody
flux, approaching seemingly his end. Paul went
to him, and laid his hands upon him, and with
simple confidence in God he prayed, and immediately
the disease was rebuked, and the man was
healed. When the natives of the island beheld
this remarkable incident, they brought others to
Paul, and they were healed, after the same fashion,
by Paul’s praying.</p>

<p>Turning back in Paul’s life to the time he was
at Ephesus on his way to Jerusalem, we find him
stopping at Tyre after he departed from Ephesus.
Before leaving Ephesus he had prayed with them
all. But he did not trust in his words howsoever
strong, fitting and solemn they might have been.
God must be recognized, invoked and sought.
Paul did not take it for granted, after he had
done his best, that God as a matter of course
would bless his efforts to do good, but he sought
God. God does not do things in a matter-of-course
sort of way. God must be invoked, sought
unto, and put into things by prayer.</p>

<p>Following his visit to Ephesus, he arrived
at Tyre, where he stopped a few days. Here
he found some disciples, who begged Paul not
to go to Jerusalem, saying through the Spirit that
he should not go up to that city. But Paul adhered
to his original purpose to go to Jerusalem. The
account says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>“And when we had accomplished those days,
we departed, and went our way; and they all
brought us on our way with their wives and children,
till we were out of the city; and we kneeled
down on the shore and prayed.”</p>
</div>

<p>What a sight to behold on that seashore!
Here is a family picture of love and devotion,
where husbands, wives and even children are
present, and prayer is made out in the open air.
What an impression it must have made upon those
children! The vessel was ready to depart, but
prayer must cement their affections and sanctify
wives and children, and bless their parting—a
parting which was to be final so far as this world
was concerned. The scene is beautiful and does
honor to the head and heart of Paul, to his person
and his piety, and shows the tender affection in
which he was held. His devoted habit of sanctifying
all things by prayer comes directly to the
light. “We kneeled down on the shore and
prayed.” Never did sea strand see a grander picture
or witness a lovelier sight—Paul on his knees
on the sands of that shore, invoking God’s blessing
upon these men, women and children.</p>

<p>When Paul was arraigned at Jerusalem, in making
his public defense, he refers to two instances
of his praying. One was when he was in the
house of Judas, in Damascus, after he had been
stricken to the earth and brought under conviction.
He was there three days, and to him was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
Ananias sent, to lay his hand upon him, at the
time of his blindness and darkness. It was during
those three days of prayer. This is the Scriptural
record, and the words are those of Ananias
addressed to him:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“And now why tarriest thou? Arise and be
baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the
name of the Lord.”</p>
</div>

<p>The Lord had emboldened the timid Ananias
to go and minister to Paul, by telling him, “Behold
he prayeth.” And so we have in this reference
Paul’s prayerfulness intensified by the exhortation
of Ananias. Prayer precedes pardon of
sins. Prayer becomes those who seek God.
Prayer belongs to the earnest, sincere inquirer
after God. Pardon of sin and acceptance with
God always come at the end of earnest praying.
The evidence of sincerity in a true seeker of religion
is that it can be said of him, “Behold he
prayeth.”</p>

<p>The other reference in his defense lets us
into the prayerful intenseness into which his whole
religious life had been fashioned and shows us
how in the absorbing ecstasy of prayer, the vision
came and directions were received by which his
toilsome life was to be guided. Also we see the
familiar terms on which he stood and talked with
his Lord:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>“And it came to pass when I was come again
to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple,
I was in a trance;</p>

<p>“And saw him saying unto me, Make haste and
get thee quickly out of Jerusalem, for they will
not receive thy testimony concerning me.</p>

<p>“And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned
and beat in every synagogue them that believed
on thee.</p>

<p>“And when the blood of thy martyr Stephen
was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting
to his death, and kept the raiment of them that
slew him.</p>

<p>“And he said unto me, Depart, for I will send
thee far hence unto the Gentiles.”</p>
</div>

<p>Prayer always brings directions from heaven
as to what God would have us to do. If we
prayed more and more directly, we should make
fewer mistakes in life as to duty. God’s will concerning
us is revealed in answer to prayer. If we
prayed more and prayed better and sweeter, then
clearer and more entrancing visions would be given
us, and our intercourse with God, would be of the
most intimate, free, and bold order.</p>

<p>It is difficult to itemize or classify Paul’s praying.
It is so comprehensive, so discursive, and
so minute, that it is no easy task to do so. Paul
teaches much about prayer in his didactics. He
specifically enforces the duty and necessity of
prayer upon the Church, but that which was better
for Paul and better for us is that he himself
prayed much and illustrated his own teaching.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
He practiced what he preached. He put to the
test the exercise of prayer which he urged upon
the people of his day.</p>

<p>To the Church at Rome he plainly and specifically
asseverated with solemnity his habit of
praying. This he wrote to those Roman believers:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“For God is my witness, whom I serve with my
spirit in the Gospel of His Son, that without ceasing
I make mention of you always in my prayers.”</p>
</div>

<p>Paul not only prayed for himself. He made a
practice of praying for others. He was preëminently
an intercessor. As he urged intercessory
prayer on others, so he interceded himself for
others beside himself.</p>

<p>He begins that remarkable Epistle to the
Romans in the spirit of prayer: He closes it with
this solemn charge: “Now I beseech you,
brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ’s sake, and
for the love of the Spirit, that ye strive with me
in your prayers to God for me.”</p>

<p>But this is not all. In the very heart of that
Epistle, he commands “Continuing instant in
prayer.” That is, give constant attention to
prayer. Make it the business of life. Be devoted
to it. Just what he did himself, for Paul was
a standing example of the doctrine of prayer
which he advocated and pressed upon the people.</p>

<p>In his Epistles to the Thessalonians, how all-inclusive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
and wonderful the praying! Says he in
writing his First Epistle to this Church:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We give thanks to God always for you, making
mention of you in my prayers; remembering
without ceasing your work of faith, and labor of
love, and patience of hope.”</p>
</div>

<p>Not to quote all he says, it is worth while to
read his words to this same Church of true believers
further on:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Night and day praying exceedingly that we
might see your face, and might perfect that which
is lacking in your faith. Now God himself direct
our way unto you. And the Lord make you
to increase and abound in love one toward another,
even as we do toward you, to the end he
may establish your hearts unblameable in holiness
before God, even our Father.”</p>
</div>

<p>And this sort of praying for these Thessalonian
Christians is in direct line with that closing prayer
for these same believers in this Epistle, where
he records that striking prayer for their entire
sanctification:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“And the very God of peace sanctify you
wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit, and
soul and body be preserved blameless unto the
coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.”</p>
</div>

<p>How Paul did pray for those early Christians!
They were in his mind and on his heart, and
he was continually at it, “night and day praying
exceedingly.” Oh, if we had a legion of preachers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
in these days of superficial piety and these times
of prayerlessness, who were given to praying for
their churches as Paul did for those to whom he
ministered in his day! Praying men are needed.
Likewise praying preachers are demanded in this
age.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of that remarkable prayer
in the third chapter of Ephesians, he declared
that “God was able to do exceeding abundantly
above all that we could ask or think,” now he
declares he is praying exceeding abundantly, striving
after the most earnest order, to have his
prayers run parallel with God’s power, and that
they may not limit that power nor exhaust that
power, but get all there is in it to bless and greatly
enrich His Church.</p>

<p>Paul and his compeers prayed for the saints
everywhere. It may be referred to again. With
what solemnity does Paul call the attention of
the Roman Christians to the important fact of
praying for them, believers whom he had never
seen! “God is my witness that without ceasing,
I make mention of you in my prayers.” To the
churches he says, “Praying always for you.”</p>

<p>Again on the same line, we hear him articulating
clearly, “Always in every prayer of mine for
you all, making request with joy.” Again he
writes thus: “I do not cease to pray for you.”
Once more we read the record, “Wherefore we
pray always for you.” And again it is written,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
“Cease not to give thanks for you, making mention
of you in my prayers.” And then he says,
“Remembrance of thee in my prayers night and
day.”</p>

<p>His declaration, “night and day praying exceedingly,”
is a condensed record of the engrossing
nature of the praying done by this praying
apostle. It shows conclusively how important
prayer was in his estimate and in his ministry,
and further shows how to him prayer was an
agony of earnest striving in seeking from God
blessings which could be secured in no other way.</p>

<p>The unselfishness of his praying is seen in his
writing to the Romans where he tells them,
“Making request if by any means I might have
a prosperous journey to come to you. For I long
to see you that I may impart to you some spiritual
gift to the end ye may be established.” The object
of his desire to visit Rome was not for selfish
gratification, the pleasure of a trip, or for other
reasons, but that he might be the means under
God of “imparting to them some spiritual gift,”
in order that they “might be established” in their
hearts, unblameably in love. It was that his visit
might give to them some spiritual gift which they
had not received and that they might be established
at those points where they needed to be
rooted, and grounded in faith, in love, and in all
that made up Christian life and character.</p>

<small>PAUL AND HIS REQUESTS FOR PRAYER</small></h2>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>I desire above all things to learn to pray. We want to
sound the reveille for the Christian warriors. We desire
to find truth of the lack of real praying. What is
it? Why is it? Why so little time spent in prayer when
Christ, who had command of His time, chose to spend
great part of it in INTERCESSION? “He ever liveth
to make intercession for us.” We believe the answer to
be the desire is in the heart, but the will is undisciplined,
the motive is present, but the affections have not melted
under hours of heavenly meditation; the intellect is keen,
yet not for hours of tireless research. The intellect and
the affections have never been linked together by the
sealing of the blessed Holy Ghost to do or die for God’s
glory in the secret places, with doors shut, lusts crucified.</i>—<span class="smcap">Rev. Homer W. Hodge.</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> many requests of Paul for prayer for
himself, made to those to whom he ministered,
put prayer to the front in Paul’s estimate of its
possibilities. Paul prayed much himself, and
tried hard to arouse Christians to the imperative
importance of the work of prayer. He so
deeply felt the need of prayer that he was given
to the habit of personal praying. Realizing this
for himself, he pressed this invaluable duty upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
others. Intercessory prayer, or prayer for others,
occupied a high place in his estimate of prayer.
It is no surprise, therefore, when we find him
throwing himself upon the prayers of the churches
to whom he wrote.</p>

<p>By all their devotion to Jesus Christ, by all
their interest in the advance of God’s kingdom
on earth, by all the ardor of their personal attachment
to Jesus, he charges them to pray much,
to pray unceasingly, to pray at all times, to pray
in all things, and to make praying a business of
praying. And then realizing his own dependence
upon prayer for his arduous duties, his sore trials
and his heavy responsibilities, he urges those to
whom he wrote to pray especially for him.</p>

<p>The chief of the Apostles needed prayer. He
needed the prayers of others, for this he practically
admitted in asking for their prayers. His
call to the apostleship did not lift him above this
need. He realized and acknowledged his dependence
on prayer. He craved and prized the prayers
of all good people. He was not ashamed to
solicit prayers for himself nor to urge the brethren
everywhere to pray for him.</p>

<p>In writing to the Hebrews, he bases his request
for prayer on two reasons, his honesty and his
anxiety to visit them. If he were insincere, he
could lay no claim to their prayers. Praying for
him, it would be a powerful agent in facilitating
his visit to them. They would touch the secret<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
place of the wind and the waves, and arrange all
secondary agencies and make them minister to
this end. Praying puts God in haste to do for
us the things which we wish at His hands.</p>

<p>Paul’s frequent request of his brethren was
that they would “pray for him.” We are to
judge of the value of a thing by the frequency
of asking for it, and by the special and urgent plea
made for it. If that be true, then with Paul the
prayers of the saints were among his greatest
assets. By the urgency, iteration and reiteration
of the request, “Pray for me,” Paul showed conclusively
the great value he put upon prayer as a
means of grace. Paul had no need so pressing
as the need of prayer. There were no values
so appreciated and appreciable as the prayers of
the faithful.</p>

<p>Paul put the great factor of prayer as the
great factor in his work. The most powerful and
far-reaching energy in Paul’s estimate is prayer.
He covets it and hoards it as he seeks the prayers
of God’s people. The earnestness of his soul
goes out in these requests. Hear him in this
entreaty for prayer he is writing to the Romans:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus
Christ’s sake, and for the love of the Spirit, that
ye strive together with me in your prayers for
me.”</p>
</div>

<p>Prayers by others for Paul were valuable because
they helped him. Great helpers are prayers.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
Nothing gives so much aid to us in our needs as
real prayers. They supply needs and deliver from
straits. Paul’s faith, so he writes to the Corinthians,
had been much tried, and he had been
much helped and much strengthened by God’s
deliverance. “Ye also helping by prayer.” What
marvelous things has God done for His favored
saints through the prayers of others! The saints
can help the saints more by fervent praying than
in any other way.</p>

<p>In the midst of envy and detraction, and in
perils by false brethren, he writes thus to the
Philippians:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“For I know that this shall turn to my salvation
though your prayer, and the supply of the
Spirit of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>“According to my expectation, and my hope,
that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but with all
boldness as always, so now also Christ shall be
magnified in my body, whether it be by life or
death.”</p>
</div>

<p>Shame was taken away, holy boldness secured,
and life and death made glorious by the prayers
of the saints at Philippi for Paul.</p>

<p>Paul had many mighty forces in his ministry.
His remarkable conversion was a great force, a
point of mighty projecting and propelling power,
and yet he did not in his ministry secure its results
by the force of his epochal conversion. His call
to the apostleship was clear, luminous, and all-convincing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
but he did not depend on that for
the largest results in his ministry.</p>

<p>Paul’s course was more clearly marked out and
his career rendered more powerfully successful
by prayer than by any other force.</p>

<p>Paul urges the Roman Christians to pray for
him that he may be delivered from unbelieving
men. Prayer is a defense and protection against
the malignity and machinations of evil men. It
can affect men because God can affect them. Paul
had not only unbelieving enemies with whom to
contend, but many Christians were prejudiced
against him to an extent which rendered it questionable
whether they would accept any Christian
service at his hands. Especially was this the case
at Jerusalem, and so prayer, powerful prayer,
must be used to remove the mighty and pernicious
force of prejudice, inflamed and deep-seated.</p>

<p>Prayer on their part for him must be used for
his safety, and also that a prosperous journey
and God’s will might bring him speedily and surely
to them, in order to bless and refresh mutually
the Roman Christians.</p>

<p>These prayer requests of Paul are many-sided
and all-comprehensive. How many things does
his request to the Roman Church include! The
request for their prayers, like the Church to whom
it is directed, is cosmopolitan. He beseeches them,
entreats them, a term indicating intensity and
earnestness, “for the sake of Jesus Christ, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
strive with him in their prayers for him.” This
he desires that he may be delivered from evil
and designing men, who might hinder and embarrass
him in his mission, then further that his
service for the poor saints might be accepted by
the saints, and that he might ultimately come
unto them with joy that they might be refreshed.</p>

<p>How full of heart earnestness is his request!
How tender and loving is his appeal! How touching
and high is the motive to the highest and
truest form of prayer, “for the Lord Jesus
Christ’s sake!” Also for the love we bear to
the Spirit, or for the love which the Spirit bears
to us; by the ties of the holy brotherhood. By
these lofty and constraining motives does he urge
them to pray for him and to “strive with him”
in their mutual praying. Paul is in the great
prayer struggle, a struggle in which the mightiest
issues are involved and imperiled; and he is in
the midst of this struggle. He is committed to
it because Christ is in it. He needs help, help
which comes alone through prayer. So he pleads
with his brethren to pray for him and with him.</p>

<p>By prayer enemies are to be swept out of the
way. By prayer prejudices are to be driven out
of the hearts of good men. His way to Jerusalem
would be cleared of difficulties, the success of his
mission would be secured, and the will of God
and the good of the saints would be accomplished.
All these marvelous ends would be secured by marvelous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
praying. Wonderful and world-wide are
the results to be gained by mighty praying. If
all apostolic successors had prayed as Paul did,
if all Christians in all these ages had been one
with apostolical men in the mighty wrestlings of
prayer, how marvelous and divine would have
been the history of God’s Church! How unparalleled
would have been its success! The glory
of its millennium would have brightened and
blessed the world ages ago.</p>

<p>We see in Paul’s requests his estimate of the
far-reaching power of prayer. Not that prayer
has in it any talismanic force, nor that it is a
fetish, but that it moves God to do things that it
nominates. Prayer has no magic, potent charm
in itself, but is only all potent because it gets the
Omnipotent God to grant its request. A precedent
basis in all prayer as expressed or understood by
Paul is that “Ye strive together with me in your
prayers for me.” It is of the nature of a severe
conflict in which Paul’s soul is engaged, a wrestle,
a hand-to-hand fight. The strain is severe and
exhaustive to all the energies of the soul, and
the issue is tossed in uncertainty. Paul in this
prayer struggle needs reënforcements and divine
help in his striving. He is in the midst of the
struggle, and will bear the brunt, but he solicits
and pleads for the help of others. Their prayers
are just now needed. He needs help to offer intense
prayers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>Prayer is not inaptly called “wrestling,” because
it is a most intense struggle. To prayer
there are the greatest hindrances and the most
inveterate foes. Mighty evil forces surge around
the closets of prayer. Enemies strong and strongly
entrenched are about the closets where praying is
done. No feeble, listless act is this praying done
by Paul. In this thing he has “put away childish
things.” The commonplace and the tame have
been retired. Paul must do this praying mightily
or not do it at all. Hell must feel and stagger
under the mightiness of his prayer stroke, or
he strikes not at all. The strongest graces and
the manliest efforts are requisite here. Strength
is demanded in the praying done by Paul. Courage
is at a premium in it. Timid touches and
faint-hearted desires avail nothing in the mind
of Paul which we are considering. Enemies are
to be faced and routed and fields are to be won.
The most unflagging and invincible bravery and
the highest qualities of Christian soldierhood are
demanded for prayer. It is a trumpet call to
prayer, a chieftain’s clarion note, sounded out
for earnest, persistent prayer as the great spiritual
conflict rages.</p>

<small>PAUL AND HIS REQUESTS FOR PRAYER</small></h2>

<p class="center">(<i>Continued</i>)</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>We announce the law of prayer as follows: A Christian’s
prayer is a joint agreement of the will and his
cabinet, the emotions, the conscience, the intellect, working
in harmony at white heat, while the body co-operates
under certain hygienic conditions to make the prayer long
enough sustained at high voltage to insure tremendous
results, supernatural and unearthly.</i>—<span class="smcap">Rev. Homer W. Hodge.</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> come to the request of Paul made to the
Church at Ephesus, found in the latter part of
chapter 6 of the Epistle to those Christians:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Praying always with all prayer and supplication
in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with
all perseverance and supplication for all saints;</p>

<p>“And for me that utterance may be given unto
me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make
known the mystery of the Gospel,</p>

<p>“For which I am an ambassador in bonds, that
therein I may speak boldly as I ought to speak.”</p>
</div>

<p>For this Church he had labored and prayed
night and day, with many watchings and tears and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
much humility. As he drew a vivid picture of
the Christian soldier, with his foes besetting him,
he gave them this charge of praying specially
for him.</p>

<p>To these Ephesian Christians he gave a comprehensive
statement of the necessity, nature and
special benefits of prayer. It was to be urgent,
covering all times and embracing all manner of
places. Supplication must give intensity, the Holy
Spirit must be invoked, vigilance and perseverance
must be added, and the whole family of saints
were involved.</p>

<p>The force of his request for prayer centered
on him, that he might be able to talk with force,
fluency, directness and courage. Paul did not depend
upon his natural gifts, but on those which
came to him in answer to prayer. He was afraid
he would be a coward, a dull, dry speaker, or a
hesitating stammerer, and he urged these believers
to pray that he might have courage, not only to
speak clearly, but freely and fully.</p>

<p>He desired them to pray that he might have
boldness. No quality seems more important to
the preacher than that of boldness. It is that
positive quality which does not reckon consequences,
but with freedom and fullness meets the
crisis, faces a present danger, and discharges unawed
a present duty. It was one of the marked
characteristics of apostolic preachers and apostolic
preaching. They were bold men, they were bold<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
preachers. The reference to the manifestation of
the principle by them is almost the record of their
trials. It is the applause of their faith.</p>

<p>There are many chains which enslave the
preacher. His very tenderness makes him weak.
His attachments to the people tend to bring him
into bondage. His personal intercourse, his obligations
to his people, his love for them, all tend
to hamper his freedom and restrain his pulpit deliverances.
What great need to be continually
praying for boldness to speak boldly as he ought
to speak!</p>

<p>The prophets of old were charged not to be
afraid of the faces of men. Unawed by the frowns
of men, they were to declare the truth of God
without apology, timidity, hesitancy or compromise.
The warmth and freedom of conviction
and of sincerity, the fearlessness of a vigorous
faith, and above all the power of the Holy Ghost,
are all wonderful helpers and elements of boldness.
How all this should be coveted and sought
with all earnestness by ministers of the Gospel
in this day!</p>

<p>Meekness and humility are high virtues of the
first importance in the preacher, but these qualities
do not at all militate against boldness. This
boldness is not the freedom of passionate utterances.
It is not scolding nor rashness. It speaks
the truth in love. Boldness is not rudeness.
Roughness dishonors boldness. It is as gentle as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
a mother with a babe, but as fearless as a lion
standing before a foe. Fear, in the mild and innocent
form of timidity, or in the criminal form
of cowardice, has no place in the true ministry.
Humble but holy boldness is of the very first
importance.</p>

<p>What hidden, mysterious mighty force can add
courage to apostolical preaching, and give bolder
utterances to apostolic lips? There is one answer,
and it is that prayer can do the deed.</p>

<p>What force can so affect and dominate evil that
the very results of evil will be changed into good?
We have the answer in Paul’s words again, in connection
with prayers made for him:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Who delivered us from so great a death, and
doth deliver; in whom we trust that he will yet
deliver us; Ye also helping together in prayer for
us. What then? Notwithstanding every way,
whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is preached,
and therein I do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.”</p>
</div>

<p>We can see how the promises of God are made
real and personal by prayer. “All things work
together for good to them that love God.” Here
is a jeweled promise. Paul loved God, but he
did not leave the promise alone, as a matter of
course, to work out its blessed results. So he
wrote to the Corinthians as we have before seen,
“I am in trouble. I trust in God to deliver. Ye
also helping together by prayer.” Helping me by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
prayer, you help God to make the promise strong
and rich in realization.</p>

<p>Paul’s prayer requests embraced “supplication
for all saints,” but especially for apostolic courage
for himself. How much he needed this courage
just as all true preachers, called of God, need
it! Prayer was to open doors for apostolical labors,
but at the same time it was to open apostolic lips
to utter bravely and truly the apostolic message.</p>

<p>Hear him as he speaks to the Church at
Colosses:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Withal praying also for us, that God would
open to us a door of utterance to speak the mystery
of Christ, for which I am also in bonds;</p>

<p>“That I may make it manifest as I ought to
speak.”</p>
</div>

<p>How appropriate such a request to be made
by a present-day preacher to his congregation!
How great the need of those things by the present-day
preacher which Paul desired for himself!</p>

<p>As in the request to the Ephesians, Paul wants
a “door of utterance” given him, that he may
preach with the liberty of the Spirit, be delivered
from being straitened in thought or hampered in
delivery. Furthermore, he desires the ability to
make manifest in the clearest terms, without confusion
of thought, and with force of utterance,
the Gospel “as he ought to speak,” and just as
every preacher should speak. Happy that preacher
who ministers to a people who pray thus for him!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
And happier still if he inwardly feels, as he faces
his responsible task and realizes how much he
needs these things to preach clearly, forcibly and
effectively, that he has urged his people to pray
for him!</p>

<p>Prayer transmutes crosses, trials and oppositions
into blessings, and causes them to work
together for good. “These shall turn to my salvation
through your prayers,” says Paul. Just
as the same things to-day in the life of the preacher
are transmuted into gracious blessings in the
end, “ye also helping together by prayer.” Saintly
praying mightily helped Apostolic preaching and
rescued apostolic men from many sore straits. So
just such praying in these days will effect like
results in faithful preaching done by brave, fearless
ministers. Prayer for the preacher avails just
as prayer by the preacher avails. Two things are
always factors in the life and work of a true
preacher: First when he prays constantly, fervently
and persistently for those to whom he
preaches; and secondly, when those to whom he
ministers pray for their preacher. Happy is the
preacher so situated. Blessed is that congregation
thus favored.</p>

<p>To the Church at Thessalonica Paul sends this
pressing request, pointed, clear, and forcible:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word
of the Lord may have free course, and be glorified,
even as it is with you;</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>“And that we may be delivered from wicked
and unreasonable men.”</p>
</div>

<p>He has in mind a race-course, on which the racer
is exerting himself to reach the goal. Hindrances
are in the way of his success and must be removed,
so that the racer may finally succeed and obtain
the reward. The “Word of the Lord” is this
racer, as preached by Paul. This Word is personified
and there are serious impediments which
embarrass the running of the Word. It must
have “free course.” Everything in the way and
opposing its running must be taken out of its roadway.
These impediments in the way of the Word
of the Lord “running and being glorified” are
found in the preacher himself, in the Church to
whom he ministers, and in the sinners around him.
The Word runs and is glorified when it has unobstructed
access to the minds and hearts of those
to whom it is preached, when sinners are convicted
for sin, when they seriously consider the claims
of God’s Word on them, and when they are induced
to pray for themselves, asking for pardoning
mercy. It is glorified when saints are
instructed in religious experience, corrected of
errors of doctrine and mistakes in practice, and
when they are led to seek for higher things and
to pray for deeper experiences in the Divine life.</p>

<p>Mark you. It is not when the preacher is
glorified because of the wonderful success wrought
by the Word. It is not when people praise him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
unduly, and make much of him because of his
wonderful sermons, his great eloquence and his
remarkable gifts. The preacher is kept in the
background in all this work of glorification, even
though he is foremost as being the object of all
this praying.</p>

<p>Prayer is to do all these things. So Paul urges,
entreats, insists, “Pray for us.” And it is not
so much prayer for Paul personally in his Christian
life and religious experience. All this needed
much prayer. It was really for him officially,
prayer for him in the office and work of a Gospel
minister. His tongue must be unloosed in preaching,
his mouth unstopped, and his mind set free.
Prayer must help in his religious life not so much
because it would help to “work out his own salvation,”
but rather because right living would give
strength to the Word of the Lord, and would
save him from being a hindrance to the Word
which he preached. And as he desires that no
hindrance should be in himself which would defeat
his own preaching, so he wants all hindrances
taken away from the churches to whom he ministers
that Church people may not stand in the way
or weigh down the Word as it runs on the race-course
attempting to reach the goal, even the
minds and hearts of the people. Furthermore, he
wishes hindrances in the unsaved to be set aside
that God’s Word as preached by him may reach
their hearts and be glorified in their salvation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>With all this before him, Paul sends this pressing
request to these believers at Thessalonica,
“Pray for us,” because praying by true Christians
would greatly help in the running of the Word
of the Lord.</p>

<p>Wise that preacher who has the eyes to see
these things, and who realizes that his success
largely depends upon praying of this kind on the
part of his people for him. How much do we
need churches now who, having the preacher in
mind and the preached Word on their hearts,
pray for him that “the Word of the Lord may
have free course, and be glorified.”</p>

<p>One other item in this request is worth noting:
“That we may be delivered from wicked and unreasonable
men.” Such men are hindrances in
the way of the Word of the Lord. Few preachers
but are harassed by them and need to be delivered
from them. Prayer helps to bring such a deliverance
to preachers from “unreasonable and
wicked men.” Paul was annoyed by such characters,
and for this very reason he urged prayer
for him that he might find deliverance from them.</p>

<p>Summing it all up, we find that Paul feels that
the success of the Word, its liberty and largeness,
are bound up in their prayers, and that their
failure to pray would restrict its influence and its
glory. His deliverance from unreasonable and
wicked men as well as his safety, he asserts, are
in some way dependent upon their prayers. These<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
prayers, while they greatly helped him to preach,
would at the same time protect his person from
the cruel purposes of wicked and unreasonable
men.</p>

<p>In Hebrews 13:9, Paul thus opens his heart
to those Hebrew Christians in asking them to
pray for him:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Pray for us, for we trust we have a good
conscience, in all things willing to live honestly.”</p>
</div>

<p>In this prayer request, Paul’s inward consciousness
of his integrity of heart and his internal witness
to his personal honesty come out and are a
basic truth of his Christian character. No room
for blame does he find in himself. “Pray for us.”
Your prayers for us will find in me honest integrity
and honest execution and honest administration
of all prayer results.</p>

<p>The request is intended to stir up the saints to
more earnest praying, more devotion to prayer,
and more urgency in prayer. Prayer must affect
his visit to them, would hasten it and enlarge its
beneficial results.</p>

<p>Paul is on the most cordial and freest terms
with Philemon. He is anxious and expects to
visit him at some future day and makes the appointment.
He takes it for granted that Philemon
is praying, for as this man had been converted
under his ministry, it is assumed that he
has been taught the Pauline lesson of prayer. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
assumes also that prayer will open up the way
for his visit, remove the hindrances and bring
them graciously together. So he requests Philemon
to prepare a lodging place for him, adding,
“I trust through your prayers I shall be given
to you.” Paul had the idea that his movements
were hindered or helped by the prayers of his
brethren.</p>

law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
